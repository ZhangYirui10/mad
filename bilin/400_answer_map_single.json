    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Donald Trump 'never changed one immigration law'\" is partially true. While Trump did not pass a comprehensive immigration law, he did make changes to immigration policies and enforcement during his presidency. For example, he implemented a travel ban targeting several predominantly Muslim countries, restricted legal immigration, and increased border security measures. However, he did not repeal or replace any existing immigration laws. The claim is half-true because it is accurate that Trump did not change any immigration laws, but it is also misleading because it implies that he did not make any changes to immigration policies or enforcement at all."

However, the claim is not entirely accurate as China has retired more coal-fired units than the US, and many European Union countries have retired a much larger percentage of their existing capacity.

While it is true that a significant number of teenage girls have considered suicide, the evidence does not suggest that the presence of biological boys in locker rooms is a cause of this. In fact, experts have dismissed any connection between exposure to trans girls in locker rooms and suicidal thoughts among teen girls. The evidence suggests that suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are more closely related to other factors, such as depression, gender identity, and LGBTQ+ youth experiences. Additionally, the claim is likely an exaggeration, as the actual data suggests that around 30% of female high school students have considered suicide, which is a much larger figure than \"a third\". The claim is likely an attempt to politicize the issue of transgender rights and to create a false narrative about the impact of transgender athletes on cisgender girls."

While Democrats have proposed and passed legislation that includes significant spending, such as the American Rescue Plan Act and the Build Back Better Act, these bills were not entirely without constraints or oversight. For example, the American Rescue Plan Act included provisions to ensure that funds were used for specific purposes, such as supporting small businesses and individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the Build Back Better Act included provisions to ensure that funds were used to address specific social and economic issues, such as climate change and healthcare.\n\nHowever, the claim that Democrats are asking for a \"blank check book\" is an exaggeration. Democrats have proposed and passed legislation that includes specific spending priorities and oversight mechanisms, rather than simply asking for unlimited funding without accountability. Furthermore, the claim that Democrats are not concerned about the repercussions of their spending is also an exaggeration, as many Democrats have expressed concerns about the impact of their spending proposals on the national debt and the economy.\n\nOverall, while the claim is partially true, it is also an exaggeration and does not accurately reflect the complexity and nuance of the Democratic Party's spending proposals."

Instead, it is a collaborative effort between member states, including the US, to develop a framework for pandemic response that is coherent with and complementary to existing international health regulations. The WHO can offer recommendations, but it cannot require countries to follow specific policies.

While Trump did make some statements about the improved recruiting results, there is no conclusive evidence that his policies were the sole cause of the improvement.

However, the claim is not entirely accurate because it implies that all citizens are automatically registered to vote, which is not the case. In India, citizens must enroll as new voters and their names must appear on electoral lists before they can vote. Reports indicate that some citizens, mostly minorities and women, have not been able to get their names added to electoral lists or were removed from the lists, which means they cannot vote.

The evidence suggests that some Democrats, such as Senator Tammy Baldwin, have cosponsored legislation to cap the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for Americans at $35 per month, but it is not clear if this is a widely supported position among all Democrats. Additionally, the claim that \"all 50 Republicans in the Senate are opposed to it\" is also not accurate.

The evidence includes statements from experts, data from reputable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and statistics on hospital admissions and deaths. Additionally, the claim is contradicted by the fact that the CDC reports a significant increase in COVID-19 deaths in 2021 compared to 2020, and that the number of deaths reported by the CDC exceeds the number of deaths reported in 2020.

The evidence shows that North Carolina received federal disaster assistance, including $750 for some individuals, and that California also received aid, but the claim's assertion that California received 100% aid for 180 days is not supported. Additionally, the claim's comparison between California and North Carolina is misleading, as it conflates two different forms of federal assistance.

Unbranded generic drugs are actually cheaper in the U.S. compared to other countries, and the claim only applies to brand-name drugs. Additionally, the evidence shows that the gap in prices varies depending on the drugs and countries included in the comparison.

While the Inflation Reduction Act did reduce the federal deficit by $160 billion over 10 years, the evidence suggests that this reduction is not solely due to Medicare negotiating drug prices. The evidence shows that the law's provisions, including the negotiation of drug prices, are expected to reduce the federal deficit by $237 billion over 10 years, with most of that reduction coming from the program spending less on prescription drugs. Additionally, the evidence highlights other factors that contributed to the deficit reduction, such as the reduction of health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Medicare coverage.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that \"bacon is up five times\" under President Joe Biden is partially true. While the evidence suggests that food prices, including bacon, have risen under Biden's presidency, the exact increase is not five times. According to the evidence, the price of bacon is only 11.5% higher than it was in January 2021, which is not a fivefold increase. However, the evidence also suggests that food prices have risen rapidly under Biden, with some categories experiencing larger increases, such as cereals and bakery goods (25.6%) and nonalcoholic beverages (21.4%). Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but exaggerates the magnitude of the increase."

The county officials investigated and are duplicating the ballots by hand to ensure the integrity of the election. There is no evidence to support the claim of widespread voter fraud in Lancaster County. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misinformation spread by critics of mail-in voting."

While it is true that some water bodies in Florida have experienced an increase in pollution, the evidence suggests that this is not a uniform trend across all water bodies. For example, the number of estuaries meeting water quality standards decreased from 2.5 million acres in 2018 to 2.1 million in 2020, but then increased to 3.1 million in 2022. Additionally, some water bodies, such as streams, showed a decline in pollution. The evidence also suggests that the problems with Florida's water are not new and predated DeSantis' term as governor. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is accurate that some water bodies in Florida have experienced an increase in pollution, but it is not accurate to say that all water in Florida is dirtier and sicker than when DeSantis first took office."

In fact, the evidence suggests that the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections were decided by a margin of less than 30,000 votes, but the 2018 gubernatorial election was decided by a margin of nearly 30,000 votes.

For example, opioid overdoses in Florida declined slightly from 2021 to 2022, and fentanyl seizures have more than doubled under the Biden administration. However, the evidence also suggests that the increase in seizures may not necessarily mean that the flow of fentanyl has been cut in half, as it could be due to increased interdiction efforts rather than a reduction in supply.

The CDC's actual use of PCR tests is to detect the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, not to collect human DNA.

On the other hand, he has also stated that he believes the drug prices are too high and that he wants to negotiate with Big Pharma to lower prices. Additionally, he has proposed measures to increase price transparency and require health insurers to disclose their negotiated drug rebates and discounts.

Additionally, the evidence shows that the Biden administration extended the public health emergency, which allowed states to receive extra federal funds for Medicaid and slowed down the removal process. While it is true that some people may be ineligible for Medicaid, the claim's assertion that Biden added 20 million ineligible people to the program is inaccurate.

The game has its roots in rugby and soccer, which were popular sports in England and were brought to North America by British immigrants. The modern version of American football as we know it today was developed in the United States, with Walter Camp being a key figure in its development.

Additionally, the evidence also mentions that in 2021, under Bragg's predecessor, 47% of felonies were downgraded to misdemeanors, and in 2020, 35% were downgraded.

While it is true that the number of patients in state and county psychiatric institutions decreased significantly from 1955 to the 2010s, this was a result of a broader coalition of policymakers, including fiscal conservatives, who sought to reduce costs and shift the burden to federal programs like Medicaid. The evidence suggests that the deinstitutionalization of mental health care was a gradual process that began in the 1950s, accelerated in the 1960s, and continued through the 2010s. While some experts agree that the coalition that supported moving away from institutionalization was broader than just \"liberals,\" it is also true that the term \"liberal\" is often used to describe the political ideology of those who supported deinstitutionalization.

Additionally, Cal Fire stated that no out-of-state vehicles were turned away or refused service, and all repairs were completed the same day. The claim that Oregon sent 60 fire trucks to California and they were being held in Sacramento for emissions testing is therefore FALSE."

The court decision in this case involved legitimately adversarial legal proceedings and the rule of law, which makes it different from expropriations in communist countries.

In reality, the majority of the aid is being spent on military support, weapons, and equipment for Ukraine, not on hiring school security personnel. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that school budgets vary by state and school district, and that the cost of hiring SWAT members would likely be much higher than $80,000 each.

The parents pulled the child out of school before any school staff could use the different name and pronouns, making it impossible for the school to have transitioned the child without parental consent.

In fact, the evidence shows that in most cases, prosecutors were either mum or sought sentences below the guidelines, and Judge Jackson's sentences were in line with this trend. Additionally, the evidence suggests that Judge Jackson was not \"soft\" on child pornography offenders, as she generally accepted prosecution recommendations for more severe cases that combined possession of child pornography with attempted or actual sexual abuse of a minor.

The evidence does not provide any concrete evidence of intentional sabotage or a deliberate attack on the environment. The incidents mentioned in the evidence are mostly natural disasters, such as wildfires, floods, and a poultry epidemic, which are not necessarily connected to each other.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim is FALSE because it contains several inaccuracies. Firstly, polar bears have not increased by 400% in 45 years. According to Andrew Derocher, professor in the department of biological sciences at the University of Alberta in Canada, scientific estimates for most of the world's polar bear populations weren't published until after the mid-1970s, making it impossible to compare the global population of polar bears to 45 years ago. Additionally, experts differ on how much climate change has affected polar bears, with some estimating a modest decline and others showing virtually no change. Secondly, whales are not nearly fully recovered. While it is true that the number of whales washing up on the Jersey shore has decreased, this is not a reliable indicator of the overall health of whale populations. Finally, the claim that koalas are doing fine is also inaccurate. Koalas are actually considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and climate change.

According to the evidence, active drug shortages grew by 12% from 276 to 309 during Biden's first 3.5 years in office, which is a smaller increase than the 35% increase during Trump's presidency. Additionally, the evidence notes that drug shortages have been a long-standing issue in the US, dating back to the Obama administration, and are caused by a variety of factors, including natural disasters, manufacturing problems, and slim profit margins on generic drugs.

However, Trump and his allies did attempt to use a creative interpretation of the law to try to get Pence to reject the electoral votes from certain states and declare Trump the winner.

Trump ended the Obama-era hiring protocol, but Biden did not reinstate it. Instead, Biden's administration created a new pathway for hiring air traffic controllers through state plan amendments. Trump's claim that Biden changed the policy is true, but his implication that Biden reinstated the Obama-era protocol is false.

The studies cited do not support the claim that women retain DNA from all their sexual partners. In fact, Dr. J. Lee Nelson, an autoimmunity researcher and rheumatologist, stated that any suggestion that male DNA is routinely retained from sexual partners has no support from any scientific study. The evidence also suggests that the presence of male DNA in women's brains is not a common phenomenon, and that it is most likely caused by pregnancy with a male child.

However, the claim that 76% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck is likely an exaggeration, as other sources suggest lower percentages. Additionally, the claim that the average American earns $3,200 per month is also incorrect, as the median household income in the US is $64,994 per year, and the average income is $91,547 annually.

The claim is half-true because it implies that the Pentagon was previously hiding this information, which is not supported by the evidence. The Pentagon has consistently stated that the facilities are owned and operated by Ukraine, and the purpose is to support peaceful and safe biological detection and diagnostic capabilities, not to develop biological weapons.

The evidence mentions that US service members have been serving in the Middle East, fighting against Islamic State militants, and that some have been killed or injured in combat. Additionally, the Defense Department official stated that \"An aspect of military service includes serving in locations where hostile actions may occur\" and that \"just because a service member is in one of these locations does not mean they are engaged in war.\" Therefore, while the claim is partially true in the sense that the US is not engaged in a declared war, it is not entirely accurate in stating that there are no US service members in active duty in a combat zone.

    "VERDICT: TRUE\nREASON: The evidence provided supports the claim that heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, with an average of 600 people dying annually from its effects. The evidence includes statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which reported that from 1999 to 2010, 8,081 people died in the United States from heat-related deaths, which translates to an average of 600 to 700 Americans per year. Additionally, the CDC found that from 2004 to 2018, the average number of annual heat-related deaths was 702. The evidence also suggests that heat deaths are often underreported, as it can be difficult to specifically ascribe a particular death to extreme heat. However, the CDC's data shows higher levels of deaths from heat, with estimates ranging from 1,300 to 2,000 deaths per year between 2008 and 2017.

However, the evidence also suggests that the city did not provide adequate notice to voters about the change, as the city's executive director acknowledged that the lack of notice was due to the pandemic and other factors.

While ByteDance is a privately-owned company, it has agreed to allow the Chinese government to take a 1% ownership stake in one of its China-based subsidiaries, Beijing Douyin Information Service Co. This \"golden share\" gives the Chinese government some level of influence over the company. However, the majority of ByteDance's shares are owned by global investors, and the company has provided disclosures showing that 60% of TikTok is owned by global investors. Additionally, ByteDance has taken steps to store U.S. user data in the Oracle Cloud in the U.S. and controlled by TikTok's U.S. subsidiary, which reduces the risk of China forcing ByteDance to turn over U.S. user data.

However, not all districts offer pre-K programs, and some have limited seats, which means that not all eligible children can access public preschool.

While the evidence suggests that the bill does not explicitly eliminate the requirement for voter ID at polling places, it does prohibit local governments from requiring voter ID at polling places. However, existing state law already prohibits requiring voter ID at polling places, so this provision does not change the current status quo. Additionally, the bill does not eliminate the requirement for voter ID at the state level, as some forms of ID are still required for certain voting purposes, such as requesting mail ballots.

For example, Sheikh Ahmad Al Katani reported that 6 million Muslims in Africa were converting to Christianity per year, and some experts acknowledge that it's possible that the number of Muslim converts to Christianity is underreported due to social pressures and legal consequences. However, other experts, such as Conrad Hackett and Gina Zurlo, have not seen reports of large-scale conversions from Islam to Christianity and emphasize the difficulty in tracking religious conversions due to various factors like birth, immigration, and changes in self-identification.

The claim also states that Mandel opposed a bill holding Communist China accountable when they cheated and stole American jobs. The evidence shows that Mandel did oppose a bill in 2011, but his reasoning was that he preferred diplomacy over tariffs. The claim is partially true, but the language used is misleading and exaggerated. The investment in companies that do business in China is not the same as loaning money to Chinese business interests.

The experts quoted in the evidence state that Russia's hypersonic weapons program is somewhat overhyped, and that the U.S. is ahead in the pursuit of a more advanced generation of hypersonic missiles. Additionally, the evidence highlights that Russia's hypersonic missiles use decades-old technology, whereas the U.S. is working on more advanced designs.

Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that the mosquitoes released were deadly or caused any harm to the crowd. However, the claim is also partially false because it implies that the mosquitoes were released intentionally as part of the festival, which was not the case. The flyover was part of the event, but it was not a mosquito release."

According to the evidence, the maximum credit for plug-in electric vehicles is $12,500, and it applies to vehicles up to $80,000. Tesla vehicles under the price threshold would be eligible for some of the credit, but there is no mention of a subsidy for people making $800,000.

While some cities have made commitments to reduce emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources, there is no credible evidence that any of the C40 cities have announced plans to ban these specific items by 2030. Additionally, the evidence suggests that some cities have made efforts to reduce emissions from food and transportation, but these efforts do not involve a complete ban on meat, dairy, new clothes, and private cars.

The video's caption mentions that some backed-up cargo ships have been rerouted to Florida, but it does not specify which ships or when they were rerouted. Additionally, experts say that it's too soon to tell whether the backlogged ships have actually pulled anchor and come to the Sunshine State.

In fact, the WHO has stated that it does not have a single global estimate for the infection fatality ratio of COVID-19, and that previous studies have estimated it at around 0.6%, which is higher than the 0.14% mentioned in the claim.

Instead, it reclassified certain nonviolent felonies to allow for earlier parole eligibility.

The law is expected to apply to about 10 million surprise bills a year. However, the claim is not entirely true because it implies that all Americans will no longer have to worry about unexpected medical bills, which is not the case.

The evidence suggests that the number of removals and returns in the past nine months (520,000) is lower than the number of removals and returns in some full years since 2015, such as 2019 (518,000). Additionally, the evidence highlights that the number of encounters, which includes apprehensions under immigration law and expulsions under Title 42, has increased, but this does not necessarily translate to an increase in removals and returns.

The evidence suggests that cancer cells can evolve quickly and become resistant to treatment, but it does not support the claim that all unusual cancers are exploding into stage 4.\n\nThe claim that those cancer cells have \"the spike protein\" is also partially true. The evidence suggests that some cancer cells may have spike proteins, but it does not provide evidence that all cancer cells with spike proteins are the result of COVID-19 vaccines.

The evidence suggests that the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for the care and placement of unaccompanied children, does not play a role in the processing of the children prior to their referral to HHS custody, but it is not clear that there is no vetting at all. Additionally, the claim that there is no transparency is also partially true, as the process is not entirely transparent, but it is not entirely accurate to say that there is no transparency at all. Finally, the claim that there is no consideration for child and public safety is also partially true, as the process does not prioritize the safety of the children or the public, but it is not entirely accurate to say that there is no consideration at all.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that BlackRock owns 59 million shares of Dominion Voting Systems, but the evidence provided shows that BlackRock has no ownership stake in Dominion Voting Systems. Additionally, the claim states that BlackRock sued itself and fired Tucker Carlson, but there is no evidence to support this claim. The evidence suggests that Dominion Voting Systems sued Fox News for defamation, and Fox News agreed to pay $787.5 million to settle the lawsuit. Tucker Carlson's departure from Fox News was not explicitly stated as being related to this lawsuit. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence provided does not support the claim that Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger are attempting to \"unseat\" U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in collusion with the Radical Left Democrats. The evidence suggests that Trump is accusing them of trying to unseat Greene, but there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, the evidence suggests that Kemp and Raffensperger certified the results of the 2020 presidential election, as required by state law, and that Trump is backing Republican challengers to both officials because they didn't go along with his efforts to overturn the election. Additionally, the evidence shows that Greene is facing a primary challenge from other Republicans, and that Trump's national win-loss record in endorsements is 92-7, with several of his top targets in Georgia beating his backed primary challengers. There is no evidence to support the claim that Kemp and Raffensperger are colluding with Democrats to unseat Greene."

The evidence suggests that the claim is false and likely originated from a Facebook post that was fact-checked and found to be false.

In fact, the school district has stated that it does not allow students to terrorize their peers and has investigated claims of harassment and bullying. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the protests and concerns about furries in schools are largely driven by misinformation and misconceptions about the community. The claim is likely exaggerated or distorted for political or sensational purposes."

While it is true that ProduceMaxx is used to wash fruits and vegetables, it is not a pesticide, herbicide, fungicide, insecticide, or antibiotic. The evidence also suggests that ProduceMaxx is used in certified organic production and food processing, and is allowed to contact organic produce. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate, but also contains some inaccuracies."

The evidence suggests that some forms of gender-affirming care, such as using the name and pronouns that align with a child's gender identity, are not experimental and are widely accepted as a standard part of gender-affirming care. Additionally, while there may be limited long-term studies on the effects of certain treatments, there are studies that demonstrate the positive impacts of gender-affirming care on transgender youth.

The bridge in Baltimore collapsed on March 24, not March 26, and there is no evidence linking the two incidents. The claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence suggests that the claim \"Gas is high because they shut down production in the U.S.\" under the Biden administration is false. The evidence shows that the increase in gas prices is due to a lack of oil production, mainly due to the post-coronavirus pandemic recovery, and not because of any actions taken by the Biden administration, such as canceling the Keystone XL pipeline. Additionally, experts say that the recent increases in U.S. gas prices are due mainly to a lack of oil production, much more than any actions taken by Biden. The evidence also shows that gas prices were already rising before Biden took office, due to the recovery after the pandemic, and that the sharpest increases at the pump have come since the start of the war in Ukraine. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

In fact, official sources, such as Maui County officials, have not determined the cause of the fires and have not mentioned any intentional human involvement. Additionally, the evidence provided includes statements from experts and officials who have dismissed the claim, and there is no credible evidence to support the notion that the fires were part of a larger plan to rebuild the island as a smart city.

Additionally, the evidence debunks the claim that Wolfe is responsible for mismanaging Wisconsin's voter rolls, as the state law governing voter lists is clear and Wolfe is not responsible for removing voters who may have moved from the rolls. The evidence also shows that the claim is part of a larger pattern of misinformation and false claims made by the Wisconsin Election Committee Inc. against Wolfe. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence suggests that the cancellation of the Keystone pipeline did not dramatically increase Americans' dependence on Russian oil. The pipeline would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, which is a small fraction of the total oil consumption in the US. Additionally, the US has remained a net exporter of energy under the Biden administration, and energy production has outpaced consumption. The claim that the cancellation of the pipeline led to a significant increase in dependence on Russian oil is not supported by the evidence. The ad's quote from S&P Global Report is also not verified, and experts have stated that the recent increases in US gas prices are due mainly to a lack of oil production, not the cancellation of the pipeline."

While it is true that Rep. Ramthun's resolution was rejected by the Assembly committee, and there is no clear indication that Republican leadership has explicitly supported it, it is also true that Republican leaders have not publicly condemned the resolution or taken a clear stance on it. The evidence suggests that Republican leaders have been ambiguous or silent on the issue, rather than explicitly opposing the resolution. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

While there have been several fires and accidents at food processing plants and farms, there is no evidence to suggest that these incidents were intentional or part of a conspiracy to create food shortages. In fact, the evidence suggests that the claims of intentional destruction are baseless and unfounded. The U.S. Department of Agriculture does not track fires or incidents at food production facilities, and there is no private group that does so. Additionally, the evidence provided does not support the claim that 1,900 food production companies have been destroyed, as the numbers and details of the incidents do not add up to that amount.

In fact, the ONE Championship, the organization Lee competed for, did not respond to PolitiFact's questions about the vaccine claims, and there is no mention of the vaccine in remembrances shared by her family or friends. Additionally, there is no credible evidence linking the COVID-19 vaccine to heart issues in athletes, and multiple sports cardiologists have called the claims unfounded.

The evidence shows that Simpkins was released from jail on October 7, 2021, after paying a $75,000 bond, but it does not specify the duration of his jail stay. Additionally, the evidence does not provide information on Rittenhouse's actual jail stay, only stating that he was released on November 20, 2020, on $2 million bail.

    "[VERDICT]: HALF-TRUE  \n[REASON]: The claim states that Joe Biden holds the all-time record for the most money received from Pharma while in Congress, with $8,550,422. However, the evidence suggests that this is not entirely accurate. According to OpenSecrets, Biden received more than $8.8 million from the pharmaceutical and health products industry, but most of this amount came during his 2020 presidential campaign, not during his time in Congress. Additionally, the evidence shows that Biden was not the top recipient of pharmaceutical industry money among people who served in Congress during his time in Congress, but rather among people who have served in Congress overall. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as Biden did receive a significant amount of money from the pharmaceutical industry, but not necessarily the most while in Congress."

The evidence suggests that the ship's pilot reported the bridge was down, and the National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating the extent of the ship's power loss. Additionally, federal and Maryland officials have referred to the event as an \"accident\" and do not think the crash was intentional. The video itself does not provide conclusive evidence of intentional damage, and the claims made by social media users are not supported by the available evidence. The claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim is partially true, but it is also misleading. Kamala Harris' plan to tax unrealized capital gains does not mean that homeowners will have to pay taxes on the increased value of their houses every year, even if they don't sell them. The plan is aimed at taxing the unrealized gains on tradable assets, such as publicly traded stocks, for individuals with a net worth of over $100 million. Homeowners who own their primary residence and do not sell it will not be affected by this plan. However, the claim is also partially true because the plan does aim to tax unrealized gains on assets, including homes, if they are sold or inherited. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also misleading in its presentation."

For example, according to the U.S. Census Bureau data, China accounted for 18% of U.S. imports of active pharmaceutical ingredients in 2019, and 1% of U.S. imports of finished pharmaceutical products. Additionally, other countries, such as Ireland and the United States itself, are also significant producers of pharmaceutical ingredients.

While there is evidence that some Republican politicians have proposed or threatened to cut taxes and reduce government benefits, including Social Security and Medicare, there is no evidence that a specific plan has been proposed that would raise taxes on almost one in three Wisconsinites and sunset Social Security and Medicare in five years. The evidence suggests that the claim is exaggerated or misleading. For example, one source states that the plan would raise taxes on 40% of the state's working class, not almost one in three Wisconsinites.

While some evidence suggests that C-sections can be performed as a method of abortion, particularly in cases of fetal anomalies or maternal health complications, it is not accurate to say that all C-sections are coded as abortions in hospitals. The evidence provided shows that C-sections are typically coded as a surgical procedure for delivery, and the term \"abortion\" is not always used in hospital coding systems. However, it is also true that C-sections can be performed as a method of abortion in certain circumstances, and some hospitals may use codes that indicate this. Therefore, the claim is half-true."

Instead, it reported on a list of athletes who had heart-related issues, but not all of them died, and some were not vaccinated. Additionally, the article included a disclaimer that not all of the people on the list became ill due to vaccination. Furthermore, medical experts and sports cardiologists have not found any evidence linking the COVID-19 vaccines to an increase in cardiac arrests among athletes.
