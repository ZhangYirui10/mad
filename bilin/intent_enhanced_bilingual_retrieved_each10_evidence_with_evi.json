      "Ultimately, Short has a point that gun homicide rates in center cities are disproportionately high compared to less-dense areas. But the share of gun homicides in center cities is nowhere near 95% of all gun homicides, much less all gun deaths including suicides.",
      "CDC data shows the five states with the highest gun homicide rates were Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Missouri and South Carolina. These states have some of the nation\u2019s most permissive laws on guns, such as allowing guns to be carried without a permit and having barriers to enforce\u00a0federal gun laws.",
      "Other states within the list of bottom 10 gun homicide rates, notably Nebraska and North Dakota, also have relatively permissive laws, according to the Guns & Ammo ranking. States with tighter gun laws, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Minnesota, are also in the bottom 10.",
      "relatively lax gun laws",
      "Beyond historical-cultural factors, many of the states with high gun homicide rates have higher poverty rates and less developed trauma care resources, both of which can affect death rates from gun violence, said Jay Corzine, a University of Central Florida emeritus professor of sociology and a homicide and gun policy expert.",

      "The paper claims the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines did not undergo adequate safety and efficacy testing.",
      "The blog post gives the impression that COVID-19 vaccination is not helpful for people who have had the virus, and that previously infected people will be able to avoid hospitalization and death if they get COVID-19 again. But that ignores the limited scope of the study and dismisses the conclusion made by researchers \u2014 that vaccination can help prevent serious illness, hospitalization and death.",
      "But the same argument can be said for the YouTube video\u2019s title \u2014 that mRNA vaccines offer \"no mortality benefit.\" It\u2019s misleading because it doesn\u2019t specify that the findings are about non-COVID-19 related deaths, that the study is a preprint, or that more research is needed.

He said the purpose was to familiarize senior officials with the theory and that no additional money was spent on CRT.\nLoudoun Superintendent Scott Ziegler says the theory is not being taught to students. He says critics are conflating the theory with Loudoun\u2019s efforts to bring equity to the way students are treated in school, where most of the money was spent.",

      "But neither the slide presentation nor information about the school district\u2019s plans confirm this claim of race-based grading.",
      "Greene spokesperson Nick Dyer told us Greene was referring to money allocated to elementary and secondary schools across Illinois, not just one school. But even without that detail, Greene\u2019s characterization of the funding is inaccurate. The money wasn\u2019t used solely for equity or diversity, and wasn\u2019t used for teaching critical race theory.",

It said the bill\u2019s direction to prioritize grant proposals that will close gaps in \"civic knowledge and achievement\" among \"underserved students\" is a push for critical race theory.",
      "There can be \"long lags in some programs between funding and spending,\" said Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-of-center Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"To see who did what and when, it\u2019s better to use budget authority, not outlays.\"",
      "Asked whether he supported the legislature\u2019s effort to expand the program\u2019s funding by about $500 million, Lassiter said: \"Not as it stands. I\u2019m deeply concerned about the allocation of public funds without strict accountability and transparency. Furthermore, I\u2019m troubled by the inclination of some to abandon our public schools in favor of privatization, where profit often takes precedence over quality education. Well-funded, well-managed public schools are the cornerstone of a self-governing society.\"",
      "The report was conducted by a credible education research group. However, the tweet leaves out key details. The national ranking pertained to North Carolina\u2019s funding ability \u2014 not its spending levels alone. The ranking is also based on budget figures from three years ago, so it doesn\u2019t provide insight into North Carolina\u2019s current funding ability or funding level.",

      "Critical race theory is a collection of ideas about systemic bias and privilege. Conservative elected officials have moved to bar critical race theory in public schools or state agencies, even when it isn\u2019t being used.",

At the time, there was a concern about a shortage of personal protective equipment, called PPE, for health care providers.

Both to prevent you, if you happen to be a person who may feel well, but has an asymptomatic infection that you don't even know about, to prevent you from infecting someone else.

      "Fauci\u2019s full comment: \"So, when you have vaccinated people who might have a breakthrough infection, and we know now as the fact, as a scientific fact, that they can transmit the virus to an uninfected person, it's for that reason that the CDC made the change in recommendation, and did, just as you correctly stated, namely, that, if you are vaccinated, if you are (in) an indoor setting, you should still wear a mask.\"",

But as I said in the past and as you accurately quoted me, the default position should be to try as best as possible within reason to keep the children in school, or to get them back to school. The best way to ensure the safety of the children in school is to get the community level of spread low. So, if you mitigate the things that you know are causing spread in a very, very profound way, in a robust way, if you bring that down, you will then indirectly and ultimately protect the children in the school because the community level is determined how things go across the board.\"",

      "Reports of people dying after they receive a COVID-19 vaccine",
      "Previous lists of athletes who purportedly died from the COVID-19 vaccines have included people who hadn\u2019t died or hadn\u2019t gotten the vaccine. There have been no official reports linking the vaccines to heart issues in athletes, and multiple sports cardiologists have called the claims unfounded.",
      "But there is no evidence COVID-19 vaccines led the athletes in the video to collapse. We reviewed the news reports mentioned in the video and spoke with a number of sports cardiologists, and we found the claim connecting the two is unfounded.",
      ". \"1,598 athlete cardiac arrests since Jan 2021. 69% fatal. (Average athlete cardiacs before vax was 29/yr),\"",
      "A news article makes the case that dozens of prominent athletes had heart attacks and died following vaccination against COVID-19, and it cites a German news story as proof \u2014 even though the story did not say any such thing.",
      "The article appeared with the headline, \"German News Agency Tracks 75 Prominent Athletes Suddenly Dead Of Heart Attacks After COVID Vax.\" It was shared on Facebook in a post that was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

      "The German story did not report that all of the athletes had died, did not say they all had heart attacks and included the disclaimer that not all of the people included on the list became ill because of vaccination.",
      "Some of the athletes listed in the German news story are alive, and some were not vaccinated against COVID-19. And some who died had a history of heart problems or a family history of death by heart attack.",
      "Medical experts in sports cardiology reaffirmed that they haven\u2019t seen a sharp rise in athlete cardiac arrest episodes since the COVID-19 vaccines came out.",
      "\"This happens to be one of the primary negative effects of the COVID vaccines among men especially, which has led to a five-fold increase in sudden and unexplained cardiac deaths in FIFA (soccer) players in 2021. \u2026 It looks like bureaucrats are already using the omicron variant to disguise the rapid increase in sudden and unexplained cardiac deaths in the vaccinated, just as they did with the delta variant,\" the article states.",
      "We\u2019ve fact-checked similar claims about athletes experiencing cardiac symptoms because of the vaccine and found them unsupported.",
      "A review of the articles Sharp sent over also showed that the reports aren\u2019t consistent. Some cite medical professionals who ruled out vaccination as a cause. Others don\u2019t include any information on the athlete\u2019s vaccination status. And some were about athletes that neither collapsed nor experienced a cardiac event."
