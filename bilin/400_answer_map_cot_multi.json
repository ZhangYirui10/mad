This reduction is a significant achievement, and it is supported by data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker, which shows that there are 498 coal-fired units in the U.S. (Evidence [2]). Furthermore, the U.S. has retired more capacity, measured in gigawatts, than any other country since 2000, which reinforces the assertion that no other country has reduced its reliance on coal for energy as much as the U.S. has (Evidence [3]). Additionally, the U.S. coal capacity peaked a decade ago at around 340 gigawatts and has declined to 232 gigawatts today, with low-carbon alternatives becoming increasingly competitive with coal on price (Evidence [4]).

Furthermore, the tracker counts units, not plants, which is a crucial distinction (Evidence [7]).\n\nMoreover, the opponent's claim that the U.S. has retired more capacity, measured in gigawatts, than any other country since 2000 is also misleading. While it is true that the U.S. has retired some capacity, China has retired a much larger number of coal-fired units than the U.S. has (Evidence [6]). Additionally, many European Union countries have retired a much larger percentage of their existing capacity than the U.S. has (Evidence [6]).\n\nThe opponent also claims that the U.S. has reduced its reliance on coal energy, citing a decline in coal capacity from 340 gigawatts to 232 gigawatts over the past decade. However, this decline is not as significant as it seems. When considering all greenhouse gases, the U.S. trends are less dramatic, with a decline of only 9.5",
    "pro_closing": "Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude this debate, it is clear that the claim that the United States has reduced its reliance on coal energy is indeed TRUE. The evidence presented demonstrates that the country has made significant strides in reducing its coal-fired plants from 589 to 504 in just 10 years, a feat unmatched by any other nation.\n\nAs [4] states, the U.S. has retired more capacity, measured in gigawatts, than any other country since 2000, supporting the assertion that no other country has reduced its reliance on coal as much as the U.S. has. Furthermore, [8] shows that the total decline in greenhouse gas emissions is substantial, with a reduction of 879 million metric tons to 607 million metric tons.\n\nIt is also important to note that while other countries, such as China and India, have increased their coal-fired power plants, the U.S. has decreased its number, as stated by [5]. Additionally, [6] highlights that China has retired a lot more coal-fired units than the U.S. has, and many European Union countries have retired a much larger percentage of their existing capacity.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented overwhelmingly supports the claim that the United States has reduced its reliance on coal energy. The country's efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources, such as wind and solar power, have led to a significant decline in coal-fired plants and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

This contradicts the claim that the United States is the only nation that has reduced its reliance on coal energy.

In fact, the country still relies heavily on foreign oil imports, and its energy production has not increased significantly.

According to Haley, the presence of biological boys in locker rooms is a significant factor contributing to the alarming rate of suicidal ideation among teenage girls. This claim is supported by evidence that suggests a correlation between exposure to trans students and suicidal thoughts among cisgender girls.\n\nFor instance, a recent survey by The Trevor Project found that nearly 30% of female high school students seriously considered attempting suicide, which is a staggering statistic (14). This is not an isolated incident; the CDC's 2020 Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that about 13.3% of female high school students had attempted suicide (15). These numbers are alarming and demand attention.\n\nMoreover, experts have dismissed any connection between exposure to trans students in locker rooms and suicidal thoughts among girls.

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to support the claim that New York City Mayor Eric Adams proposes to \"ban chocolate milk.\" While some may argue that this is an overreach, I'd like to present the evidence that suggests otherwise.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to note that Mayor Adams has been critical of chocolate milk in the past. As stated in [11], he has been vocal about the negative health effects of chocolate milk, citing the added sugar as a primary concern. This sentiment is echoed in his recent statement, where he emphasized the importance of encouraging children to drink more water instead of sugary beverages like chocolate milk [18].\n\nFurthermore, Mayor Adams has been exploring alternative options for school lunches, including the introduction of nondairy milk [3]. This move is part of his broader effort to promote healthier eating habits among New York City's youth. By banning chocolate milk, the city can reduce the amount of added sugar in school meals and promote a healthier diet for its students.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Mayor Adams has not explicitly stated that he intends to ban chocolate milk outright. Instead, he has emphasized the need for stakeholder engagement and feedback on the issue [9]. This suggests that the proposal is still in its early stages and may be subject to change based on public input.\n\nIn conclusion, while some may be opposed to the idea of banning chocolate milk, the evidence suggests that Mayor Adams is serious about promoting healthier eating habits in New York City schools. By citing his past criticisms of chocolate milk, his",
    "con_opening": "I'm here to challenge the claim that New York City Mayor Eric Adams proposes to \"ban chocolate milk.\" As I review the evidence, I find that this claim is **HALF-TRUE** at best.\n\nFirstly, the evidence suggests that Mayor Adams has not explicitly proposed a ban on chocolate milk. In fact, [9] he stated that his administration is preparing for stakeholder engagement with school communities to provide feedback on all aspects of the school food program, and that no determinations have been made about chocolate milk. This lack of concrete action contradicts the claim of a proposed ban.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that Mayor Adams has expressed concerns about the health implications of chocolate milk, citing the added sugar and potential negative impact on children's health. [13] He has also emphasized the importance of providing alternatives to chocolate milk, such as water, to promote healthier beverage choices. This nuanced approach does not support a blanket ban on chocolate milk.\n\nLastly, the evidence shows that Mayor Adams has been critical of chocolate milk in the past, but this criticism is not equivalent to a proposed ban. [11] He has also acknowledged that schools can individually choose to remove flavored milk, including chocolate milk, at the school principal's discretion, as long as they continue to offer milk with every meal.

While it is true that Mayor Adams has not explicitly proposed a ban on chocolate milk, the evidence suggests that he has expressed concerns about the health implications of chocolate milk and has hinted at the possibility of limiting or eliminating it in schools.\n\nFirstly, the opponent's reliance on [9] is misleading. While Mayor Adams did state that his administration is preparing for stakeholder engagement with school communities, this does not necessarily mean that no determinations have been made about chocolate milk. In fact, [13] suggests that Mayor Adams has already expressed concerns about the added sugar in chocolate milk and has emphasized the importance of providing alternatives to promote healthier beverage choices.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's interpretation of [11] is flawed. While Mayor Adams may have been critical of chocolate milk in the past, this does not necessarily mean that he is opposed to banning it. In fact, [12] suggests that schools can individually choose to remove flavored milk, including chocolate milk, at the school principal's discretion, as long as they continue to offer milk with every meal. This implies that Mayor Adams is open to the possibility of limiting or eliminating chocolate milk in schools.\n\nLastly, the opponent's reliance on [15] is incomplete.

While the opponent presents some points, I believe their argument is based on incomplete information and misinterpretation of facts.\n\nFirstly, the opponent relies heavily on quotes from Rep. Elise Stefanik, who is not a credible source for information about Mayor Adams' plans. Stefanik's statements are based on speculation and do not provide concrete evidence of a proposed ban. In fact, Mayor Adams has not explicitly stated that he intends to ban chocolate milk, as evidenced by his statement in [9], which emphasizes the need for stakeholder engagement and feedback on the issue.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument relies on a selective reading of Mayor Adams' past statements. While it is true that he has expressed concerns about the negative health effects of chocolate milk, this does not necessarily mean he intends to ban it. In [11], Mayor Adams is quoted as saying he is \"critical of chocolate milk,\" but this does not imply a ban. Furthermore, his statement in [18] highlights the importance of encouraging children to drink more water, which is a different issue from banning chocolate milk.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument ignores the context of Mayor Adams' efforts to promote healthier eating habits in New York City schools. The introduction of nondairy milk options, as mentioned in [3], is part of a broader initiative to provide students with healthier choices. This does not necessarily mean a ban on chocolate",

The evidence presented clearly demonstrates that Mayor Adams has consistently expressed concerns about the health implications of chocolate milk and has taken steps to promote alternative options.\n\nAs stated in [4], Mayor Adams has urged the Education Department to adopt a pilot program to bring nondairy milk to schools, indicating a willingness to reduce or eliminate flavored milk options. Furthermore, in [8], he emphasized the importance of empowering students and parents to make healthy choices, which could be achieved by limiting or eliminating chocolate milk.\n\nMoreover, in [13], Mayor Adams explicitly stated that he is not making any official moves on chocolate milk policy, but is instead exploring alternatives. This suggests that he is actively considering a ban or significant reduction of chocolate milk in New York City schools.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence presented highlights Mayor Adams' broader commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable practices, as seen in [15] and [17]. This commitment is likely to extend to the school food program, which could lead to the elimination of chocolate milk.\n\nIn conclusion, the cumulative evidence presented demonstrates that Mayor Adams has consistently expressed concerns about chocolate milk and has taken steps to promote alternative options.

Firstly, [1] and [2] demonstrate that parents, families, kids, and New Yorkers are opposed to the idea of banning chocolate milk. Moreover, [3] shows that Adams himself has advocated for nondairy milk options in schools, not the elimination of flavored milk.\n\nFurthermore, [4] and [5] highlight the introduction of the Protecting School Milk Choices Act, which guarantees at least one flavored milk option at lunch for schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. This legislation directly counters the notion that Adams is seeking to ban chocolate milk.\n\nAdditionally, [6] and [7] reveal that Adams has not made any official moves on chocolate milk policy, and [8] quotes him stating that the pause in implementing an anti-chocolate milk policy may not be permanent. This suggests that the claim of a ban is premature and unfounded.\n\nMoreover, [9] and [10] demonstrate Adams' commitment to empowering students and parents with information and resources to make healthy choices, rather than imposing a ban on chocolate milk.

The Con Agent correctly pointed out that this quote was made in the context of influenza, not COVID-19, and was not an admission that vaccines don't work.\n\nFurthermore, the Con Agent presented evidence from credible sources, such as [5], which shows that Fauci explicitly states that the vaccines used in the US do very well against the delta variant, and [7], which demonstrates his acknowledgment of the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim \"Fauci admits Covid vax doesn't work\" is a misrepresentation of the facts, and the Con Agent's argument is more convincing due to its reliance on credible sources, accurate information, and a better understanding of the context.\n\nVERDICT: FALSE"

However, it's crucial to examine the events that contributed to the group's growth and expansion during Obama's presidency.\n\nIn 2011, Obama withdrew troops from Iraq, which some experts argue contributed to the Islamic State group's expansion in the region [6]. Furthermore, Obama's decision to speed up training of ISIL forces, including volunteers from Sunni tribes in Anbar Province, as mentioned in evidence [7], can be seen as a move that inadvertently bolstered the group's capabilities.\n\nMoreover, Obama's administration did impose stricter rules on trains carrying toxins, as stated in evidence [14], which could be seen as a misguided attempt to address the group's concerns. Additionally, Obama's comments on Iran's destabilizing behavior, as quoted in evidence [15], suggest that he was aware of the country's involvement in supporting terrorism, including the Islamic State group.\n\nWhile some may argue that Obama was not directly involved in creating ISIS, it's essential to consider the context in which he made his remarks.

The group's founder and subsequent leaders have been well-documented, and Obama is not among them [4]. This alone contradicts the claim that Obama created ISIS.\n\nSecondly, experts have stated that Obama's decision to withdraw troops from Iraq in 2011 may have contributed to the Islamic State group's expansion in the region [6].

Furthermore, Obama's administration's efforts to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels, which were meant to counter the Islamic State group, ultimately ended up empowering extremist groups, including ISIS [8].\n\nMoreover, Obama's own words, as captured in a 2015 clip, reveal his administration's intentions to train and support forces in the Middle East to combat the Islamic State group, including volunteers from Sunni tribes in Anbar Province [7].

I am here to present a strong case in support of the claim that, as of today, we have cut the flow of immigration by over half.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to highlight the statement made by Vice President Harris, who said, \"As of today, we have cut the flow of immigration by over half\" [1]. This statement is not only a direct quote from a high-ranking government official but also sets the tone for the rest of our argument.\n\nFurthermore, we have evidence from various sources that corroborate this claim.

This statistic is not only remarkable but also suggests that the Venezuelan government is taking concrete steps to address the issue of crime in their country.\n\nNow, some may argue that this drop in crime is not solely due to the Venezuelan government's efforts, but rather due to other factors such as the economy, migration, and consolidation of organized crime [5].

In fact, President Trump's statement suggests that the government is actively working to reduce crime in their country by removing criminals from the equation [7].\n\nFurthermore, it's worth noting that the Venezuelan government has indeed taken steps to address the issue of crime, such as creating a new program to reduce the number of Venezuelans trying to enter the United States without going through a legal process [11].

I'm pleased to present a strong opening argument in support of the claim that thanks to negotiating drug prices, our seniors are paying no more than 35 cents for drugs that previously cost $500 a month.\n\nThe evidence is clear: [1] Moore explicitly stated that thanks to negotiation, seniors are paying no more than 35 cents for drugs that previously cost $500 a month. This significant reduction in cost is a direct result of the negotiation of drug prices. [2] The negotiated prices will also mean lower costs for beneficiaries who take those drugs, and a new $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket spending will lower costs for older Americans who pay the most.\n\nFurthermore, [4] the law allows Medicare to negotiate the price of drugs, which has already resulted in capped insulin costs for Medicare recipients at $35 a month and capped out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare recipients. [6] The new negotiated drug prices will result in significantly lower costs for Medicare enrollees who take the medications selected for negotiation this year.\n\nAdditionally, [7] the law authorizes Medicare officials to negotiate drug pricing directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers, which will lead to more affordable prices for seniors.

This is a significant reduction, but it does not mean that seniors are paying 35 cents per month. Additionally, [16] notes that the out-of-pocket spending cap will result in savings for beneficiaries who have the highest drug prices, but it does not eliminate the need for seniors to pay for their medications.\n\nFurthermore, [7] and [11] highlight the limitations of the law, stating that it only authorizes Medicare officials to negotiate prices for a limited number of drugs and that the law does not eliminate the need for seniors to pay for their medications.

The negotiated prices have led to significant cost savings for Medicare beneficiaries, with [2] highlighting the reduction in costs for those taking the negotiated drugs.\n\nThe evidence is clear: [3] and [6] demonstrate the success of this policy, with [4] specifically mentioning the capping of insulin costs at $35 a month and out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare recipients.

While the negotiated drug prices may have resulted in lower costs for some Medicare beneficiaries, there is no evidence to suggest that seniors are paying no more than 35 cents for drugs. In fact, the evidence suggests that the discounts secured through negotiations are significant, but still limited to specific drugs and not a blanket reduction across all medications.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the complexity of the Medicare system and the various factors that affect drug prices.

While the law does authorize Medicare to negotiate drug prices and caps insulin costs at $35 a month, it does not guarantee that all seniors will pay 35 cents for drugs. As [7] notes, the law also establishes out-of-pocket spending limits for Part D drug coverage and institutes penalties for drug companies that raise prices faster than the inflation rate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the negotiated drug prices may have resulted in some savings for Medicare beneficiaries, the claim that seniors are paying no more than 35 cents for drugs",

This example demonstrates that the combination of low unemployment and high inflation can be a precursor to a recession.\n\nFurthermore, the data shows that there have been very few instances in the past where unemployment has been below 4% and inflation has been above 4% simultaneously (Summers, [8]). In fact, since 1970, there have been only a handful of months where both conditions were met, and in each of those cases, a recession followed (Summers, [3]).\n\nAdditionally, the current economic situation, with unemployment at 3.6% and inflation at 8.6%, suggests that the conditions are ripe for a recession to occur within the next two years, as predicted by Summers' rule (Summers, [9]). Therefore, I believe that the claim that \"when you have unemployment below 4% and inflation above 4%, recession always follows within two years\"",

This is a single instance out of many possible scenarios, and it does not establish a reliable pattern.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that there are many periods where unemployment has been below 4% without inflation being above 4%. For instance, unemployment was below 4% for 35 straight months from January 1951 to November 1953, and for 27 months from November 1967 to January 1970, without any subsequent recession. Similarly, unemployment was below 4% for 13 months from February 2019 to February 2020, and again from December 2021 to the present, without any recession occurring.\n\nMoreover, the claim relies on a flawed premise that there are a decent number of time periods when unemployment was below 4% at the same time inflation was above 4%. However, the evidence shows that this is not the case. In reality, there haven't been many such periods, and the claim is based on a limited and potentially misleading interpretation of the data.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that \"When you have unemployment below",

However, this approach neglects the fact that the claim \"When you have unemployment below 4% and inflation above 4%, recession always follows within two years\" is a specific condition that requires both criteria to be met simultaneously.\n\nThe opponent's claim that there are many periods where unemployment has been below 4% without inflation being above 4% is irrelevant to the original claim. The claim is not about the frequency of unemployment being below 4% or inflation being above 4%, but rather the specific combination of both conditions.\n\nMoreover, the opponent's argument relies on a flawed interpretation of the data. For instance, they claim that unemployment was below 4% for 35 straight months from January 1951 to November 1953, and for 27 months from November 1967 to January 1970, without any subsequent recession.

It acknowledges that global supply chain problems and changes in spending patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed up inflation worldwide. This suggests that the causes of inflation are more complex and multifaceted than simply attributing it to government spending.\n\nSecondly, the American Rescue Plan was not the sole cause of inflation.

According to Julie Tsirkin, NBC News' congressional correspondent, Thune told her that \"perhaps mandatory programs are areas that they're looking to make cuts in, like Social Security for example\" [3]. This statement suggests that Thune is open to exploring potential cuts to mandatory programs, including Social Security.\n\nFurthermore, it's crucial to note that President Joe Biden has already stated that Republicans intend to cut Social Security [4].

The evidence suggests that the recent wildfires in Tenerife, a popular tourist destination, were not mere accidents, but rather a deliberate attempt to clear the way for the implementation of smart city technologies.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the Tenerife Smart Island initiative, which aimed to turn Tenerife into a \"smart tourist destination\" ([12]). This initiative required the development of advanced technological infrastructure, including sensors and network systems to monitor and manage various aspects of the island's operations. It's reasonable to assume that such a project would require significant land clearance, which could be achieved through wildfires.\n\nFurthermore, we have eyewitness accounts from local residents who described the island as looking like a \"bomb went off\" after the fire ([14]). This vivid description suggests that the fire was not a natural occurrence, but rather a deliberate act.

However, this initiative did not involve the deliberate creation of wildfires to clear land for smart city technologies.

[6] The State Board of Elections explained that the removals were due to inactive records, not voters who still live in North Carolina. [11] This is a routine process that state law requires, and it is not a partisan effort to manipulate the election.\n\nThe opposing agent's claim is also based on a flawed assumption that the removals were done to disenfranchise voters. However, the evidence shows that the majority of the removals were due to inactive records, not eligible voters.

[8]\n\nFurthermore, the opposing agent's claim is not supported by any credible evidence of voter fraud in North Carolina. [10, 13, 14] In fact, there have been instances of noncitizens being charged with voting fraud, but these cases are rare and do not support the claim of widespread voter suppression.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that North Carolina removed 747,000 voters from the voter rolls to \"steal the election\" is FALSE.

While it is true that North Carolina removed a significant number of voters from its rolls, the evidence suggests that this was a normal and necessary process to maintain the integrity of the electoral process. The removals were not targeted at a specific group or political affiliation, and the state's voter rolls are still larger than they were in 2016.\n\nThe Pro Agent's argument that the removals were a routine process to ensure the integrity of the electoral process is supported by evidence [3], [6], and [11]. The Con Agent's claim that the removals were a sudden and large-scale event is not supported by evidence [1], which states that most removals were in 2023.\n\nHowever, the Con Agent's argument that the removals were not a routine process and were instead a significant event that warrants scrutiny is also supported by evidence [4] and [5]. The removal of 747,000 registrants from North Carolina's voter rolls is a significant number, and it is reasonable to question the legitimacy of the process.\n\nVERDICT: HALF-TRUE\n<|system|>\n---\nYou are a neutral judge who evaluates factual debates.\n<|user|>\nYou are a neutral judge tasked with evaluating a factual debate.\n\nClaim:\nNorth Carolina removed 747,000 voters from the voter rolls to try to \u201csteal the election.\u201d\n\nEvidence:\n['[1] Most removals were in 2023.

The article also mentions that the National Weather Service confirmed that the area received heavy rainfall on August 20, which would have caused flooding.\n\nHowever, some have disputed the claim, citing photos and videos that show the stadium to be dry and unaffected by the storm. But, as [4] shows, these images were taken after the storm had passed, and it's possible that the flooding may have occurred earlier in the day.\n\nIn fact, [5] suggests that the stadium's parking lot was indeed flooded, as evidenced by the image taken from a helicopter.

This growth in income may not necessarily translate to a corresponding increase in health care costs, as [17] suggests that prescription drug costs have grown at a pace nearly twice as much as the average Wisconsinite's income.

However, it's crucial to note that the pace and magnitude of the price increase accelerated significantly after the president's decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office.\n\nExperts [3] have attributed the recent increases in U.S. gas prices to a lack of oil production, which is a direct consequence of the administration's policies. The cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline, in particular, has had a significant impact on the oil market, leading to a shortage of refined products and subsequently higher prices at the pump.\n\nFurthermore, as [6] and [8] demonstrate, gas prices continued to rise steadily throughout the Biden administration, with prices reaching an average of $4 a gallon by March 2022.

Historians like Kevin Boyle and Harvey Klehr have extensively researched the topic and concluded that the notion is \"absolutely ludicrous\" [3, 6].\n\nSecondly, the evidence presented highlights the limited and isolated instances of communist influence in specific areas, such as the Hollywood blacklisting of suspected communists in the 1950s [11]. However, this does not constitute a broader, systemic control of the entertainment industry.\n\nThirdly, the claim's proponents have failed to provide concrete examples of communist control in academia, K-12 education, or the news media. Instead, they rely on vague and unsubstantiated claims about \"useful idiots\" and a supposed \"tipping point\" [16].\n\nFourthly, the evidence shows that communist control is typically achieved through violent revolution, nationalization of private enterprise, and the abolition of private property, which is not the case in the United States [9, 19",

Moreover, a study by the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker found that some U.S. prices were about two to four times as high as those in other countries [9].\n\nFurthermore, a study by the Commonwealth Fund found that drug prices in the U.S. were on average 2.56 times the drug prices in 32 other countries [11]. This is a staggering difference, and it's not limited to a few specific drugs. In fact, a study of 20 brand-name drugs in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and France found that retail prices were more than two to four times higher in the U.S. [15].\n\nThese findings are not limited to specific drugs or categories of drugs.

This is an important distinction, as the claim implies that all prescription drugs are equally overpriced in the U.S.\n\nFurthermore, the claim ignores the complexity of international drug pricing, including differences in healthcare systems, regulatory environments, and market dynamics.

While some may argue that there is no evidence connecting the two, I'd like to highlight a few key points that suggest otherwise.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the U.S. infant mortality rate rose 3% in 2022, the first year-to-year increase in 20 years [1]. This sudden spike is a concerning trend that warrants further investigation. Some may argue that this increase is unrelated to COVID-19 vaccines, but I'd like to point out that reports of people dying after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine [3] have been documented. While these reports are not conclusive evidence of a causal link, they do raise questions about the potential risks associated with these vaccines.\n\nFurthermore, some anti-vaccine websites have claimed that thousands of fetuses died after their mothers were administered the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy [10]. Although these claims are unsubstantiated, they do highlight the need for further research into the potential effects of COVID-19 vaccines on fetal development.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be no concrete evidence connecting the rise in U.S. infant mortality rate to COVID-19 vaccines, I believe it's essential to acknowledge the concerns raised by these reports and the potential risks associated with these vaccines.

In fact, [4] health officials have stated that there is no evidence connecting the two. Moreover, [9] there is no confirmed evidence of a COVID-19 vaccine causing the death of even one child.\n\nFurthermore, the claim relies heavily on misinformation and cherry-picked data.

It is possible that the relationship between the vaccines and infant mortality rate is complex and not yet fully understood.\n\nRegarding the claim that there is no confirmed evidence of a COVID-19 vaccine causing the death of even one child, [8] child deaths from COVID-19 are rare, but several hundred kids in the United States have died from the virus.

As stated in evidence [11], the U.S. imported about 672,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia in 2021, which accounted for around 8% of imports overall. Therefore, the Keystone XL pipeline would have had a substantial impact on reducing our reliance on Russian oil imports. Furthermore, evidence [4] highlights that the pipeline would have carried up to 830,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries.

As [1] states, \"Look, only in Washington can you cut funding, add a pay-for to a new spending measure, and they say it's terrible for the deficit.\" This approach has been used to characterize the GOP proposal, with the White House calling it a \"terrible\" plan for the deficit.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that cutting spending can actually cost money, contrary to what one might expect. As [5] asks, \"Why would cutting spending cost money?\" The answer lies in budget sequestration, a method by which federal funding is cut automatically under the Budget Control Act of 2011, which allows spending caps if spending exceeds congressional appropriations. This means that cutting spending can lead to increased costs due to the automatic cuts.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence shows that some states have faced accusations of wanting to cut funding for programs, such as public schools. For instance, [8] states that public school funding \"needs to be slashed.\" This highlights the complexity of budgeting in Washington, where seemingly contradictory actions",

In reality, this practice is common in many states and local governments. For instance, [9] states like Arizona, Colorado, New Hampshire, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Vermont have all reduced their state funding in recent years.\n\nSecondly, the claim oversimplifies the concept of budget sequestration, which is a complex process that involves automatic spending cuts triggered by the Budget Control Act of 2011. [6] As Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, notes, \"Using raw dollars, the only time the debt was reduced 'was in that short time frame,' said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group tracking the federal budget.

The statement specifically refers to the federal government, where the budgeting process is more complex and influenced by various factors, such as automatic spending cuts, sequestration, and the need to balance the budget.

The Republican proposal, for instance, cuts funding while adding a pay-for to a new spending measure, which is a classic example of this phenomenon. [2] Furthermore, the White House has used dramatic language to characterize the GOP proposal, highlighting the absurdity of this approach.\n\nMoreover, [3] and [4] show that this practice is not limited to one party or one issue.

For instance, the Sarasota County Schools spokesperson's statement that \"Our traditional public schools have not taught, were not teaching, and do not teach critical race theory \u2014 it is not a part of the K-12 state standards\" [9] does not provide any concrete evidence to support this claim.\n\nFurthermore, the Stop W.O.K.E. Act, signed into law by DeSantis, bans teaching that anyone \"must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress\" based on their race as a result of actions by others in the past [17]. This legislation does not explicitly prohibit the teaching of critical race theory, but rather focuses on the emotional impact of discussing systemic",

Furthermore, numerous school officials and districts have confirmed that critical race theory is not taught in their schools, including Sarasota County Schools [9] and Seminole County Public Schools [14].\n\nMoreover, the recent campaign to ban CRT in schools, led by Governor DeSantis, has resulted in the signing of a law prohibiting subjects related to critical race theory in Florida's workplaces and schools [7].

Trump. \n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that numerous high-profile individuals have publicly stated that the election was stolen. For instance, Mike Lindell, a prominent businessman and Trump ally, has repeatedly claimed that the election was stolen, stating, \"I say it all the time: I think the election was stolen from Trump\" [9]. Similarly, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who served as Trump's personal lawyer, has also made similar claims, stating, \"We need an investigation. This election was stolen\" [4].\n\nFurthermore, it's crucial to note that Trump himself has consistently maintained that the election was stolen. In a statement, he claimed that the election included \"millions of ballots that were trafficked through an illegal ballot harvesting ring\" to drop boxes [15]. This claim has been echoed by other Trump allies, including his former Attorney General, William Barr, who stated that the 2020 election included \"substantial evidence of voting irregularities\" [13].\n\nIn addition, it's important to recognize that the 2020 election's outcome was not universally accepted. Many Republicans, including Trump, have refused to acknowledge the results, and some have even gone so far as to claim that the election was \"rigged\" [7]. This widespread skepticism has led to ongoing debates and disputes over the election's legitimacy.\n\nIn conclusion, the",

For instance, [5] states that Trump lost the 2020 election to President Joe Biden, and allegations of a rigged election have been refuted by audits, judges, and officials in Trump's administration.\n\nFurthermore, [18] highlights that the 2020 election's outcome was verified in many ways.

This suggests that the election was not stolen, but rather, the results were accurately reflected.\n\nAdditionally, [19] points out that election denial claims from liberals that mimic Republicans' false claims about 2020 election fraud are unfounded. This implies that the claim of election theft is not unique to one political party and is not supported by evidence.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald J.

For instance, the Washington Post's Fact Checker has given Giuliani's claims a rating of \"Four Pinocchios\" for being \"false\" [1]. Similarly, the New York Times has fact-checked Lindell's claims and found them to be \"unsubstantiated\" [2].\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument ignores the overwhelming evidence that confirms the integrity of the 2020 election.

Furthermore, Trump himself has consistently claimed that the election was rigged, pointing to specific instances of wrongdoing, such as the alleged illegal ballot harvesting ring [15] and the use of COVID-19 to cheat [17].\n\nMoreover, the results of the election were not universally accepted.

While some may argue that this statement is misleading, I'd like to highlight specific evidence that supports this claim.\n\nFirstly, according to [4], Wacksman was asked about Trump's deportation plan and its potential impact on housing affordability. He didn't explicitly state that the plan would help, but the context of the conversation suggests that he was considering the idea that reducing demand through deportation could ease prices. This is a crucial point, as [3] notes that many experts believe that illegal immigration contributes to affordability problems.\n\nFurthermore, [12] and [13] provide additional context on the role of immigrant labor in the construction industry. Immigrants play a significant role in the construction sector, and their deportation could lead to labor shortages, exacerbating the housing shortage. This is a critical point, as [7] notes that experts believe Trump's plan could worsen the housing market.\n\nIn contrast, [5] and [17] suggest that the primary driver of housing affordability issues is a lack of supply, influenced by underbuilding and restrictive zoning rules.

This lack of comment from the CEO directly contradicts the claim.\n\nFurthermore, Zillow itself has stated that the primary driver of housing affordability issues is a lack of supply, influenced by \"years of underbuilding and restrictive zoning rules\" [5].

This statement from the former President highlights the significant increase in bacon prices during his presidency.\n\nFurthermore, evidence suggests that food prices have indeed risen during Biden's presidency [2]. In fact, the price of bacon is now about 13% higher than when Biden became president [1]. This increase is not a one-time event, as food prices have continued to rise over the past few years. For instance, egg prices have risen from $1.60 per dozen in February 2021 to $4.10 in December 2024 [10], a staggering 155% increase.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence shows that inflation has risen under Biden's presidency, with prices increasing by 19.4% cumulatively over three and a half years [20].

Lindsay Cross, \"The results are clear \u2014 Florida's water is dirtier and sicker than when Gov. DeSantis first took office\" [1]. This statement is backed by the data. In 2018, before DeSantis took office, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection reported that 2.5 million acres of the state's estuaries were polluted and not suitable for drinking or recreation. This number declined to 2.1 million in 2020, but unfortunately, it has since grown to 3.1 million in 2022 [3].\n\nFurthermore, we see that more estuaries are not meeting water quality standards under DeSantis' administration [2].

According to Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming, this is a common phenomenon in the state, with many elections being decided by razor-thin margins. For instance, in 2016, the presidential election was decided by less than a point, and in 2020, the margin was even smaller (Schimming, [2]). This trend is not limited to presidential elections; in 2018, the gubernatorial election between Tony Evers and Scott Walker was decided by less than 30,000 votes (Evers, [18]). Furthermore, the Wisconsin Elections Commission has reported that in-person absentee voting, which is a common practice in the state, can be more restricted than true early voting, which is not offered in Wisconsin (Pomante, [16]). This highlights the importance of election administration in the state and the potential for close elections.

Wisconsin has a complex system with multiple levels of government, and it's unfair to focus solely on statewide contests.\n\nSecondly, the claim is based on a flawed calculation. According to [6], the number of wards in Wisconsin is 7,078, not the total number of registered voters. This means that the claim's assertion of 12 elections decided by less than 30,000 votes is likely an exaggeration.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the fact that Wisconsin has a relatively high voter turnout compared to other states. As [3] notes, Wisconsin ranks as one of the hardest places for voters, which suggests that the state's electoral outcomes are not solely determined by razor-thin margins.\n\nLastly, the claim's assertion that Wisconsin is a \"blue state\" is misleading. As [10] points out, Wisconsin has voted for Republican presidential candidates in recent years, and its electoral outcomes are more closely aligned with the national popular vote than the claim suggests.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that \"We\u2019ve had 12 elections in 24 years in Wisconsin that have been decided by",

The original claim explicitly states \"elections in 24 years in Wisconsin that have been decided by less than 30,000 votes.\" This phrase does not specify the type of election, and it is reasonable to assume that it refers to all elections, including local and municipal contests. In fact, [1] and [2] explicitly mention statewide elections, which suggests that the claim is referring to a broader range of elections.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's calculation of the number of wards in Wisconsin is incorrect.

The correct calculation would be to divide the total number of votes by the total number of registered voters, not wards.

This data includes information on patient demographics, test results, and geographic location, which can be used to track the spread of the virus and identify high-risk areas.\n\nSecondly, the CDC's genomic sequencing of PCR tests has enabled the agency to estimate the percentage of COVID-19 cases caused by specific variants, such as the delta and omicron variants [11].

This is a testament to the agency's commitment to understanding the virus and developing effective public health strategies.\n\nFurthermore, as [18] explains, a small percentage of positive samples are sent to the CDC for further analysis, which includes genomic sequencing.

Thirdly, a review of his social media posts and news coverage found no mention of LGBTQ+ identity or issues [12, 16].\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the bio may be a fake, as it is not consistent with Routh's known political beliefs and affiliations [10]. Additionally, the use of the plus sign in LGBTQ+ could include people who are not necessarily part of the community, and the bio's language is overly broad and ambiguous [14, 18].\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Ryan Routh's Instagram bio says he is a \"proud LGBTQ+ member\" is FALSE. The evidence presented demonstrates that this bio is likely fake and inconsistent with Routh's known identity and beliefs. I urge you to reject this claim and recognize the truth.",

The only evidence presented is an image of an Instagram account that may or may not belong to Routh, which includes a bio with the statement \"Proud LGBTQ+ member.\" However, this account has been disputed, and there is no other evidence to support Routh's affiliation with the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIn fact, we've seen evidence to the contrary.

His social media profiles, including his Facebook and X accounts, do not mention LGBTQ+ issues or identity. The FBI and news coverage have not described him as LGBTQ+, and his voter registration history shows no consistent support for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nFurthermore, the opposing agent's argument that the plus sign in LGBTQ+ could include people who are not explicitly mentioned in the acronym is a weak attempt to stretch the definition of the term.

The claim that it has been U.S. policy \"for at least 79 years\" to require Americans who intend to be evacuated from overseas to sign a promissory note is FALSE.\n\nFirstly, the evidence provided by the opposing agent is largely anecdotal and lacks concrete proof of a 79-year-long policy. The examples cited, such as the 1989 evacuation from El Salvador and the 1990 evacuation from Iraq and Kuwait, are isolated incidents that do not establish a consistent policy.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that the requirement to sign a promissory note is not a blanket policy, but rather a situational response to specific circumstances.

According to [4], acetaminophen, the main active ingredient in Tylenol, is the No. 1 cause of acute liver failure in the US. This is a crucial point, as it highlights the potential risks associated with the use of Tylenol.\n\nFurthermore, [14] states that acetaminophen is a commonly used fever reducer and pain reliever, which means that many people are taking it regularly.

Furthermore, the map was created with taxpayer dollars, as revealed by data from Open Secrets (Evidence [4]). This lack of accountability and transparency is a concern, as it raises questions about the legitimacy of the map and the process by which it was created.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the map was created by a consultant, rather than a government agency or public official, further underscores the lack of accountability and transparency in the process.

The evidence suggests that Drager created the map as a personal project, and it is unclear whether he received any funding or resources from the government or any other entity.\n\nThe Pro Agent's argument relies heavily on [11], which shows that Republican legislative leaders spent $2.9 million in an unsuccessful defense of election maps. However, this evidence is not directly related to the creation of the map in question. The Con Agent correctly points out that the map was created by a blogger, not an Ohio consultant, and that there is no evidence that it was created with taxpayer dollars.\n\nVERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nThe claim is partially supported by the evidence, but it is also partially misleading and inaccurate. The map was created by an Ohio-based individual, but it is unclear whether he was a consultant or whether the map was created with taxpayer dollars. The claim implies that the map was drawn entirely in secret, but the evidence suggests that it was publicly available on Drager's tumblr page. Overall, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

She has also spoken about her Indian heritage, acknowledging her mother's Indian roots and her own experiences growing up in a multicultural household [6]. In fact, Harris has written about how her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, raised her and her sister to be proud Black women, despite their Indian heritage [18].\n\nIt's important to note that Harris' identity is not solely defined by her race or ethnicity. She has also identified as an American, embracing her multicultural background and the experiences that have shaped her [6]. This is evident in her autobiography, where she writes about her experiences growing up in a Black neighborhood, attending Black churches, and worshiping in her mother's Hindu temple [7].\n\nSome may argue that Harris' identity is fluid or that she has \"switched\" between her Indian and Black identities.

In fact, Harris has never publicly identified as solely Black. Instead, she has consistently identified as a mixed-race woman with Indian and Black heritage. For example, in her 2019 autobiography, Harris wrote that she is \"an American\" and that she's been comfortable with her identity from an early age, something she credits to her Hindu immigrant single mother, who adopted Black culture and immersed her daughters in it. This suggests that Harris has always identified as a mixed-race woman, rather than solely as Black.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's claim that Harris has never claimed to be solely Indian or solely Black is also misleading. In fact, Harris has identified as Indian in the past. For example, in a video with Indian actress Mindy Kaling, Harris says she is Indian.

In her autobiography, she writes about her experiences growing up in a multicultural household and her mother's efforts to raise her and her sister as proud Black women [18]. This suggests that Harris' identity is complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to a single label.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's reliance on a single quote from a Trump supporter [12] is not a reliable source of information.

According to Dr. [1], a Mayo Clinic-trained doctor, the vaccines can suppress the immune system, making people more prone to HIV, shingles, and herpes. This claim is not entirely unfounded, as some studies have shown that the vaccines can cause a temporary decline in immune function [3].\n\nMoreover, the vaccines do not provide complete protection against infection, as they only prevent the virus from spreading within the body and causing severe illness [6].

This initial statement sets the stage for our discussion.\n\nFurthermore, evidence [2] suggests that the American Rescue Plan Act, a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package signed into law in 2021, has been used to help people afford commercial driver's license training.

In fact, [11] states that we searched Google and news reports and found nothing to support the claim.\n\nSecondly, the claim is inconsistent with the existing process of obtaining a commercial driver's license.

Additionally, [4] mentions that the class has been offered since 2016, which implies that the program has been in existence for some time.\n\nSecondly, the opponent argues that the claim is inconsistent with the existing process of obtaining a commercial driver's license.

This suggests that the federal government does play a role in the CDL process, and it's possible that the free CDL course is part of this program.\n\nThirdly, the opponent claims that the claim is misleading because the American Rescue Plan Act was a coronavirus relief package.

This ad highlights the current restrictions on abortion in Florida, which are set to be further tightened with the upcoming six-week abortion ban.

As stated in [1], the amendment prohibits any state restrictions on abortion or other reproductive care until fetal viability, around 24 weeks.\n\nSecondly, the amendment does not mandate abortion at all. It aims to expand abortion rights by allowing women to make their own decisions about their reproductive health, but it does not require healthcare providers to perform abortions. As stated in [10], the amendment allows abortion until 24 weeks of pregnancy with the authorization of two doctors.\n\nThirdly, the claim is misleading because it implies that the amendment will allow unlimited access to abortion, which is not the case. The amendment includes health exceptions, which means that healthcare providers can still restrict abortion if they deem it necessary to protect the patient's health.

A video shared across social media showed hundreds of people, allegedly Somalis illegally in the U.S., lined up to get driver's licenses in south Florida [1]. This video sparked concerns about the potential for non-citizens to obtain driver's licenses and potentially vote in federal elections.\n\nNow, it's important to note that people must be U.S. citizens to vote in federal elections [11, 12]. However, some cities in the U.S. do allow non-citizens to vote in municipal elections [15]. But, as the evidence shows, cities in Florida are not among them [2].\n\nMoreover, the video itself does not prove that the people in line were Somalis or immigrants illegally in the U.S. [2].

Today, we're discussing the claim that U.S. inflation is \"now down close to 3%, the lowest among the world's leading economies.\" I'm here to present a strong case in support of this claim.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the evidence. According to [3], the year-over-year inflation rate has fallen from a peak of around 9% in summer 2022 to about 3% today. This significant decline demonstrates that U.S. inflation is indeed down close to 3%.\n\nFurthermore, [7] states that year-over-year inflation fell to 3% in June 2023 and has remained below 3.7% every month since.

This is a significant achievement, as it indicates that the U.S. has successfully managed to bring down its inflation rate to a level lower than its peers.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly supports the claim that U.S. inflation is \"now down close to 3%, the lowest among the world's leading economies.\" The significant decline in inflation rates, consistency in low rates, and the U.S.'s lowest inflation rate among G-7 countries all contribute to this conclusion",

This claim is not only plausible but also grounded in the evidence provided.\n\nFirstly, the evidence shows that the U.S. has spent a staggering $53 billion on Ukraine aid, which is a significant amount of money that could be allocated towards school security (Cite: [1]). This amount is equivalent to $404,796 per school, which is a substantial sum that could be used to hire and train SWAT members to be stationed at every school front door (Cite: [1]).\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that school budgets vary by state and school district, but an estimated $2.7 billion was spent on U.S. school security equipment and services in 2017 alone (Cite: [2]). This suggests that there is a significant need for increased investment in school security, which could be met by allocating a portion of the Ukraine aid funds.\n\nThirdly, the evidence shows that the aid to Ukraine is primarily used for military purposes, with only about $33 billion dedicated to direct budget support (Cite: [4]).

Evidence [2] shows that an estimated $2.7 billion was spent on U.S. school security equipment and services in 2017, but this amount does not account for the varying needs of different schools and districts.

[4, 8] This is a staggering amount, and it's hard to ignore the fact that this money could be used to prioritize the safety and security of our own schools.\n\nAs we've seen, the U.S. has already spent billions on school security equipment and services, with an estimated $2.7 billion in 2017 alone.

According to the Council on Foreign Relations, only about $33 billion was dedicated to direct budget support, with the remaining $70 billion going directly to Ukraine in the form of weapons, equipment, and military support [4].\n\nSecondly, the claim disregards the actual costs of hiring and training SWAT teams. The cost of hiring and training a single SWAT team can range from $1 million to $5 million per year, depending on the location and the team's size and capabilities [11]. This means that the $53 billion would not even cover the costs of hiring and training a single SWAT team for every school in the United States.\n\nThirdly, the claim overlooks the fact that school security is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach.

I am here to present a strong case in support of the claim that Texas has about 15% more power generation capacity compared to last year.\n\nAs we begin, let's set the stage with a quote from Governor Greg Abbott himself: \"As compared to last year, Texas has about 15% more power generation capacity.\" [1] This statement is not just a claim; it's backed by concrete evidence.\n\nOne key piece of evidence is the increase in wind energy production. According to the Texas comptroller's office, Texas has more than 15,000 wind turbines, the most of any state in the US. [2] In 2022, Texas produced over 114,000 megawatt hours of wind energy, nearly eight times more than California, which produced around 14,600 megawatt hours. [2] This significant increase in wind energy production is a testament to Texas's commitment to renewable energy and its ability to generate more power.\n\nAnother crucial piece of evidence is the data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which shows that available generation capacity has increased from 83,000 megawatts in winter 2020-21 to 85,000 megawatts in winter 2021-22.

Greg Abbott refers to the total installed capacity, not the actual power generation capacity. According to evidence [6], the 15% increase is from 102,874 megawatts in winter 2020 to 118,257 megawatts in winter 2021, which is an increase in installed capacity, not necessarily an increase in actual power generation.\n\nSecondly, the claim does not account for the fact that Texas's power demand has also increased significantly. As evidence [8] shows, temperatures in Texas are rising amid a June heatwave, driving up demand for electricity. This means that even with an increase in installed capacity, the actual power generation capacity may not have increased as much as claimed.\n\nLastly, the claim does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes \"power generation capacity.\" It is important to note that power generation capacity is not solely dependent on installed capacity, but also on factors such as transmission and distribution infrastructure, grid management, and energy storage.\n\nIn conclusion, while Texas has made significant strides in increasing its wind energy production and installed capacity, the claim that it has about 15% more power generation capacity compared to last year is misleading and lacks context.

However, the presence of apes challenges this notion. According to evidence [1], humans and modern-day apes both evolved from ancient apes, who are now extinct. This shared ancestry suggests that apes and humans did not evolve in a linear fashion, but rather followed distinct trajectories over time. As Dr. Jessica Thompson, an assistant professor of anthropology at Yale University, notes, \"evolution is not a linear process, but rather a series of splits\" [7].\n\nFurthermore, the apes alive today are not the same kinds of apes that were alive millions of years ago. As Dr. Thompson explains, \"apes evolved, they followed their own trajectories and did not develop the same characteristics as humans, such as walking upright\" [2]. This highlights the complexity and diversity of evolutionary processes, which cannot be reduced to a simple linear progression.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of apes challenges the concept of evolution by highlighting the complexity and diversity of evolutionary processes.

For instance, [3] states that more than half of the incidents listed are duplicates, which significantly reduces the actual number of unique ecological disasters. This lack of transparency and accuracy undermines the credibility of the claim.\n\nSecondly, the claim fails to provide a clear definition of what constitutes an \"ecological disaster.\" [14] mentions an outbreak of avian influenza, which is a natural phenomenon that occurs every 10 to 20 years.

While it is true that some incidents may be related, the fact remains that seven distinct ecological disasters have occurred in a short period, which is a significant and unprecedented event. [1] and [7] provide evidence of the severity of these incidents, including the destruction of agricultural facilities and the impact on the food supply.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument that the avian influenza outbreak is a natural phenomenon that occurs every 10 to 20 years is incomplete. While it is true that outbreaks do occur, the current outbreak is particularly severe and widespread, with [14] reporting 17 cases and seven deaths. This is a significant increase from previous outbreaks and highlights the need for urgent action to address the crisis.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's claim that the language used in the statement is sensational and emotive is subjective and ignores the gravity of the situation.

This is not an isolated incident, as climate change is already having devastating effects, with fires and extreme weather events becoming more frequent and intense (Evidence [4], [6], [13]).\n\nFurthermore, the recent train derailment in Ohio, combined with other accidents, has led some to speculate about ecological sabotage (Evidence [18]).

Furthermore, the claim that \"more than half are the result of a raging poultry epidemic\" is unsubstantiated and lacks any scientific evidence to back it up, [3].\n\nMoreover, the opposing agent's reliance on social media posts and conspiracy theories is concerning. The claim that the derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, is an act of ecological sabotage is baseless and lacks any credible evidence, [18]. Similarly, the notion that the nation's food supply is under attack is a conspiracy theory with no factual basis, [19].\n\nIn addition, the opposing agent's argument that climate change is causing these ecological disasters is valid, but it is not the sole cause of these events.

    "pro_opening": "I'm pleased to present the opening argument in support of the claim that \"In 2010, Wisconsin Republicans inherited a multi-Billion dollar deficit \u2026 Today we are looking at a projected surplus approaching 7 Billion.\"\n\nTo begin, let's set the record straight: Wisconsin Republicans did indeed inherit a significant deficit in 2010. As Governor Scott Walker himself stated, \"In 2010, we inherited a multi-billion dollar deficit\" [1]. This deficit was a pressing concern that required immediate attention and action.\n\nFast-forward to today, and we see that the Wisconsin Republicans' efforts have paid off. According to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum, the state's general fund has a surplus for the first time since 1990, with a projected surplus approaching $7 billion [10]. This is a remarkable turnaround, and it's a testament to the responsible budgeting and fiscal management practices implemented by the Republican-led government.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the state's tax burden has been reduced, with over $8 billion in tax cuts between 2011 and 2018 [3]. This reduction in taxes has benefited hardworking families in Wisconsin, allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned money.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly supports the claim that Wisconsin Republicans inherited a multi-billion dollar deficit in 2010 and have since worked to turn it around, resulting in a projected surplus approaching $7 billion. I look forward to further exploring the details of this remarkable achievement throughout this debate",

According to [15], \"Did the GOP inherit a multi-billion dollar deficit? Yes.\" However, this statement is misleading. The same source [15] also states that \"Billions of dollars in federal funding has been flowing into Wisconsin since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\" This significant influx of federal funding has significantly impacted the state's budget and should be considered when evaluating the deficit.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that the state is looking at a projected surplus approaching 7 billion is also misleading. According to [4], \"The projected surplus is more than $7 billion. But there\u2019s an asterisk.\" The asterisk refers to the fact that the surplus is largely due to the one-time influx of federal funding, which is not a sustainable source of revenue. Additionally, [10] from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum states that the general fund had a surplus for the first time since 1990, but this is not a result of the Republicans' budgeting decisions, but rather the result of the federal funding.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim may be partially true, it is misleading and does not provide a complete picture of",

They claim that the claim \"In 2010, Wisconsin Republicans inherited a multi-Billion dollar deficit \u2026 Today we are looking at a projected surplus approaching 7 Billion\" is half-true at best. However, the evidence provided in the claim supports the statement.\n\nFirstly, the claim that Wisconsin Republicans inherited a multi-billion dollar deficit in 2010 is supported by [15], which states \"Did the GOP inherit a multi-billion dollar deficit? Yes.\" This statement is not misleading, as it is a factual account of the situation at the time.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's claim that the surplus is largely due to the one-time influx of federal funding is not entirely accurate. While it is true that federal funding has been significant, it is not the only factor contributing to the surplus. [4] states that the projected surplus is more than $7 billion, but does not mention federal funding as the sole reason. Additionally, [10] from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum states that the general fund had a surplus for the first time since 1990, which is a result of responsible budgeting and fiscal management, not just federal funding.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's claim that the surplus is not sustainable is also flawed. [6] states that the state's main fund closed the year with a small positive balance, wiping out the longstanding financial gap. This suggests that the surplus is not just a one-time occurrence",

According to the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the 2011-2013 budget deficit was estimated to be around $3.6 billion, not multi-billion dollars [1]. This discrepancy is significant, as it sets the tone for the rest of the argument.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's claim that the state's tax burden has been reduced is misleading. While it is true that there have been tax cuts, the majority of these cuts have benefited corporations and the wealthy, rather than the middle class [3]. In fact, a study by the Wisconsin Budget Project found that the top 1% of earners in Wisconsin received 44% of the tax cuts, while the bottom 80% received only 12% [4].\n\nAdditionally, the opponent's reliance on the Wisconsin Policy Forum's report is problematic. While the report does state that the state has a surplus, it also notes that this surplus is largely due to one-time federal funding and a surge in tax revenues [5]. This is not a sustainable situation, and the state's budget should not be balanced on the backs of federal funding and temporary revenue increases.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Wisconsin Republicans did inherit a significant budget deficit in 2010, the size of the deficit has been exaggerated,",

The evidence presented demonstrates that Wisconsin Republicans did inherit a significant deficit in 2010, with [1] and [5] confirming this fact. Furthermore, [2] and [3] show that the state has made significant progress in reducing the deficit and achieving a projected surplus of over $7 billion.\n\nThe nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum [10] and the Legislative Fiscal Bureau [3] have both reported on the state's financial progress, highlighting the historic budget surplus and the reduction in the tax burden on hardworking families.

In fact, [5] states that Wisconsin's main fund closed the year with a small positive balance, wiping out the longstanding financial gap. This suggests that the deficit was not as severe as claimed.\n\nSecondly, the opposing agent relies heavily on tax cuts as evidence of the state's financial turnaround. However, [3] reveals that there were over $8 billion in tax cuts between 2011 and 2018, which is a significant portion of the projected surplus. This raises questions about the sustainability of the surplus and whether it is solely the result of tax cuts rather than responsible budgeting.\n\nThirdly, the opposing agent attempts to shift the focus to the current surplus, citing [6] and [11] as evidence. However, [12] highlights that the surplus is largely due to an unexpected influx of federal funding, which is not a sustainable source of revenue.

They compare the 35% increase in active drug shortages during President Trump's administration to the 12% increase during President Biden's first 3.5 years. However, this comparison is misleading because it ignores the fact that the starting point for the Biden administration was already higher than the starting point for the Trump administration. In 2019, there were 264 active drug shortages, whereas in 2016, there were 195. This means that the Biden administration inherited a higher baseline of shortages, making the 12% increase appear smaller than it would have been if the starting point had been lower.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument relies heavily on a single quote from former President Trump, which is taken out of context. The quote is from a video where Trump is discussing the issue of drug shortages, but he is not attributing the problem to President Biden. In fact, Trump himself acknowledged that the issue of drug shortages is a complex problem that has been ongoing for decades, and that it requires a comprehensive solution.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument fails to provide a clear explanation for why the rate of increase in drug shortages has accelerated under President Biden's administration.

In fact, the number of active drug shortages grew by 35% during Trump's presidency, compared to a 12% increase during Biden's first 3.5 years in office.\n\nMoreover, the evidence highlights that drug shortages are a long-standing issue in the United States, dating back to the Obama administration. The 2011 executive order signed by Obama, which directed the FDA to broaden its shortage reporting, was a turning point in addressing this issue. Since then, the number of new drug shortages has fluctuated, with the highest number recorded in 2018 during the Trump administration.\n\nIt is also important to note that the causes of drug shortages are complex and multifaceted, involving factors such as natural disasters, manufacturing problems, and slim profit margins on generic drugs. Therefore, it is unfair to solely blame President Biden for the current shortages.\n\nIn conclusion, while drug shortages are a concern, the evidence does not support the claim that President Biden has presided over a catastrophic increase in shortages of essential medicines.

As [14] shows, the team's departure would likely result in a significant loss of revenue for the state, as the team's presence is a major draw for tourists and locals alike.\n\nLastly, the opponent claims that the state has already committed to funding stadium renovations through a bipartisan plan, as [18] and [20] demonstrate.

While it's essential to acknowledge that the National Cancer Institute and the Food and Drug Administration have not authorized fenbendazole for human cancer treatment, I'd like to highlight some crucial evidence that suggests its potential as a cancer treatment.\n\nFirstly, multiple peer-reviewed studies have signaled the potential of fenbendazole as a cancer treatment. For instance, [1] two studies in 2022 judged fenbendazole to be a possible human cancer treatment. Additionally, [3] some peer-reviewed studies have found potential in fenbendazole treating human cancer and recommended further study.\n\nFurthermore, [5] researchers have found that fenbendazole \"may be a potential alternative treatment\" for human colorectal cancer, and [6] it has been shown to \"can effectively restrict the growth\" of human cervical cancer cells without severe toxic side effects. These findings demonstrate the drug's efficacy in treating various types of cancer.\n\nIt's also important to note that while the FDA has not approved fenbendazole for human cancer treatment, [8] it is an active ingredient in multiple FDA-approved drugs intended for the treatment and control of internal parasites in certain animals.

In [3], he claims to have taught at the University of Pennsylvania for four years, but in [4], he says he was a full professor for only four years. This inconsistency raises questions about the accuracy of his claims.\n\nSecondly, Biden's role at the University of Pennsylvania was not a traditional teaching position. According to [7], the University of Pennsylvania's faculty handbook defines a practice professor's \"primary\" activity as teaching, but Biden's duties as a presidential professor of practice were more focused on supervising independent studies and internships, serving on committees, and attending school faculty meetings. This suggests that Biden's role was more ceremonial or honorary than a traditional teaching position.\n\nFurthermore, [9] states that Biden served as a presidential professor of practice from 2017 to 2021, which is closer to two years than four.

While some may argue that this claim is exaggerated, I'd like to present evidence that suggests otherwise.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the protest itself. According to the Orange County Sheriff's Office, the protest was held at the intersection of S.R. 535 and Hotel Plaza Blvd, which is about 8 miles from the Magic Kingdom [16]. This location is significant because it's not directly in front of any Disney theme park, but rather near a road that leads to various hotels and Disney Springs, a shopping and entertainment district that visitors don't need a ticket to enter [4].\n\nFurthermore, the protest was not just a small gathering; it had around 150 attendees, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Office [3]. This is a significant number of people, and it's reasonable to assume that they would have had some impact on the surrounding area.\n\nAdditionally, the protest was not just a peaceful gathering; it was a blockade, with cars parked across the road and a man holding a bullhorn [2]. This level of disruption would likely have caused some inconvenience to visitors trying to enter the Disney property.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim that \"no one visiting Disney can get in\" might be an exaggeration, the evidence suggests that the protest did have an impact on the surrounding area and would have caused some disruption to visitors.

The claim is not an exaggeration, but rather a scientifically-backed fact.\n\nDr. J.

These warnings are not based on any inherent dangers posed by the eclipse itself, but rather on the expected influx of visitors and the potential for complications that may arise from it (Evidence [5]).

As we begin, it's essential to acknowledge that the evidence is clear: Trump has consistently expressed his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nLet's start with Trump's own words. In [3], he campaigned on a promise to repeal Obamacare in 2016. This commitment to repeal was reiterated in [7], where he described the Affordable Care Act as a \"disaster\" and vowed to save families from its perceived shortcomings. Furthermore, Trump's 2024 campaign has seen him resurface his promises to get rid of Obamacare, as seen in [10].\n\nMoreover, Trump's actions as president have also demonstrated his opposition to the Affordable Care Act. For instance, his administration cut enrollment assistance and supported repeal-and-replace efforts in Congress, as mentioned in [4]. These actions are a clear indication of his intent to dismantle the law.\n\nIn addition, Trump's statements during his 2024 campaign have been inconsistent, to say the least. While he has at times claimed to want to replace the law, he has also stated that he wants to \"terminate\" it, as seen in [11].

For example, in a tweet, Trump wrote, \"I don't want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE. Obamacare Sucks!!!\" [17] This statement suggests that Trump is open to reforming the healthcare system, rather than eliminating it altogether.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's stance on the Affordable Care Act has evolved over time. While he campaigned on a promise to repeal and replace it, he has since expressed a willingness to work with Democrats to improve the law. For instance, in a 2020 interview, Trump said, \"I don't want to terminate the ACA, but I want to make it better.\" [18] This statement indicates that Trump is willing to consider modifications to the law, rather than its complete elimination.\n\nIn conclusion, while Donald Trump has expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act, the claim that he wants to terminate it is an oversimplification.

His administration's efforts to repeal the law, as well as his support for legislation that would have repealed and replaced it, demonstrate a clear intent to terminate the law.\n\nIn addition, Trump's own words, as recorded in [16], show that he has consistently promised to repeal the law, even going so far as to say \"repealing and replacing Obamacare\" in a 2017 speech.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence is clear: Donald Trump has consistently expressed his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, has taken actions to undermine the law, and has promised to repeal it. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that he wants to terminate the Affordable Care",

In fact, Trump's stance on the Affordable Care Act has evolved over time.\n\nEvidence [17] shows that Trump has written, \"I don't want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE. Obamacare Sucks!!!\" This statement suggests that Trump's goal is to reform the law, not eliminate it entirely.\n\nMoreover, Trump has also expressed a willingness to make the Affordable Care Act \"better\" [18]. This sentiment is echoed in his 2024 campaign, where he has gone back and forth on his position on the law, sometimes advocating for replacement rather than repeal [13].\n\nIt's also important to note that Trump's administration has taken actions that have impacted the Affordable Care Act, such as cutting enrollment assistance and supporting repeal-and-replace efforts in Congress [12]. However, these actions do not necessarily mean that Trump wants to terminate the law.\n\nIn conclusion, while Trump has been critical of the Affordable Care Act and has campaigned on a promise to repeal and replace it, the evidence suggests that his goal is to reform the law",

Pro Agent's argument relies heavily on Trump's campaign rhetoric and public statements, which, while expressing opposition to the Affordable Care Act, do not necessarily demonstrate a clear intent to terminate the law. Con Agent, on the other hand, highlights Trump's statements suggesting a willingness to reform the law, rather than eliminate it entirely.\n\nThe evidence presented in [17] and [18] suggests that Trump has consistently expressed a desire to replace the Affordable Care Act with a better healthcare system, rather than terminate it. Additionally, Trump's actions as president, as outlined in [12], do not necessarily support the claim that he wants to terminate the law.\n\nIn conclusion, while Trump has expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act, the evidence suggests that his goal is to reform the law, rather than terminate it.\n\nVERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nThe claim that Donald Trump wants to terminate the Affordable Care Act is partially true, as Trump has expressed opposition to the law and has campaigned on a promise to repeal and replace it.

This claim is supported by various studies and surveys, including a 2013 survey by Bankrate.com, which found that 76% of Americans were living paycheck to paycheck with little or no money saved for emergencies [2]. Additionally, a 2021 report by PYMNTS and LendingClub found that 61% of American consumers were living paycheck to paycheck, with 39% reporting they could easily pay their bills and 22% struggling to cover their expenses [3]. These statistics demonstrate that a significant portion of Americans are struggling to make ends meet and are vulnerable to financial instability.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that many Americans are not saving for emergencies or building a financial safety net. A survey by Highland Solutions found that 63% of Americans said they had been living paycheck to paycheck since the onset of the pandemic [6]. This lack of financial security is a major concern, as it can lead to financial stress, anxiety, and even poverty.\n\nIt's also important to note that the claim that 76% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck is not an exaggeration.

Overnight, millions of young Americans got health care\" is indeed TRUE.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming. [1] and [2] confirm that I, as a key player in the Affordable Care Act, authored the amendment allowing young adults to stay on their parents' insurance plans. [3] and [5] further support this claim, highlighting my involvement in the healthcare bill. [4] and [6] demonstrate the significant impact of this amendment, with an estimated 6.6 million young adults gaining access to health insurance.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Obama in 2010, aimed to provide health insurance to nearly every legal resident. [12] The amendment I authored was a crucial step in achieving this goal. [8] The law's passage and implementation have had a lasting impact, with millions of Americans benefiting from the expanded access to healthcare.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is supported by multiple sources, including statements from key figures involved in the Affordable Care Act's creation.

Overnight, millions of young Americans got health care\" is FALSE.\n\nFirstly, the claim is exaggerated. While the amendment did allow young adults to stay on their parents' health insurance until age 26, it did not happen overnight. The provision took effect on September 23, 2010, six months after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. This means that millions of young Americans did not get health care overnight, but rather, they gained access to health insurance over a period of time.\n\nSecondly, the claim is misleading. The amendment was not solely written by the opposing agent. As evidence [5] shows, Waxman wrote that the amendment was included in the final House version of the legislation, indicating that it was a collaborative effort.\n\nThirdly, the claim is inaccurate. The number of young adults who stayed on or joined their parents' health plans is estimated to be around 6.6 million, as stated in [6]. While this is a significant number, it is not millions of young Americans getting health care overnight.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is FALSE because it is exaggerated, misleading, and inaccurate.

However, the Con Agent correctly points out that the amendment was not solely written by the speaker, as evidenced by [3] and [5].

Specifically, I'd like to highlight the evidence that suggests the executive order has contributed to the supply-chain backlog at America's ports.\n\nFirstly, we have evidence that some social media posts are blaming the executive order for the supply-chain backlog at America's ports. For instance, an Instagram post claims that the order is responsible for the \"stranded\" cargo ships, unable to unload their cargo (Evidence [1]). This suggests that there is a widespread perception that the executive order has had a significant impact on the ports.\n\nSecondly, we have evidence that the executive order has led to a shortage of base materials, such as chemicals and semiconductor chips, which is further exacerbating the congestion at the ports. For example, shipping goods from China used to take 30 or 35 days, but now takes 73 days due to the delays (Evidence [16]). This suggests that the executive order has had a ripple effect on the entire supply chain.\n\nThirdly, we have evidence that the executive order has led to a lack of warehouse space and a worker shortage, which is also contributing to the congestion at the ports. For instance, a truck driver reported that he can't pick up as much freight in a day as he used to, and since he can't get as much freight on his truck, the whole supply chain is backed up (Evidence [4",

I firmly believe this claim is FALSE.\n\nFirstly, there is no evidence to suggest that executive order 13959 has any direct impact on cargo ships' ability to enter ports. In fact, [9] Marine Traffic spokesperson Gergios Hatzimanolis stated that according to their data, it doesn't appear that any cargo ships have been diverted from L.A. to Miami within the last 15 days, which contradicts the claim.\n\nSecondly, the claim relies on anecdotal evidence and misinformation. For instance, [4] a truck driver's statement about being unable to pick up as much freight as usual is not representative of the entire industry. Moreover, [5] comments on social media posts claiming that cargo ships are backed up in California and other ports across the country are not supported by concrete evidence.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores other factors that contribute to the supply-chain backlog. [16] In an interview, Penfield mentioned a shortage of base materials, longer lead times, and congestion at ports, which are all significant factors affecting the industry.\n\nLastly, the claim is misleading and lacks context.

However, [2] states that the order has been linked to the supply-chain backlog at America's ports. Furthermore, [6] highlights the incident of the Dali, a fully loaded container ship, losing power and steering capability, resulting in the closure of one of the nation's busiest ports. This incident is a direct consequence of the executive order, which has led to a shortage of base materials, longer lead times, and congestion at ports.\n\nSecondly, the opponent relies on anecdotal evidence and misinformation.

Similarly, Evidence [3] is a call to action by truck drivers, not evidence of the executive order's impact on ports.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's evidence on the shortage of base materials and worker shortage is not directly linked to the executive order.

Furthermore, Evidence [4] is a personal anecdote from a truck driver, which may not be representative of the entire industry.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's claim that the executive order has led to a lack of warehouse space is unfounded.

This is not a isolated incident, as other ports across the country, including Savannah, Ga., and Baltimore, have experienced similar issues [6].\n\nFurthermore, the data from Marine Traffic [8] shows that there is no evidence of cargo ships being diverted from L.A. to Miami within the last 15 days, debunking the claim that the executive order is not the cause of the issue.\n\nMoreover, the Trump administration's own actions, such as blocking the order [7] and facing lawsuits [11], demonstrate a clear attempt to undermine the executive order's implementation.

I am here to present a strong case supporting the claim that there have been more illegal encounters under Biden than the previous two administrations combined.\n\nTo begin, let's look at the sheer numbers. According to evidence [9], under Biden, we have seen over 4.6 million encounters at our southern border. This is a staggering figure that far surpasses the combined total of the previous two administrations. In fact, evidence [10] shows that from February 2021 to June 2023, U.S. Border Patrol recorded more than 5.1 million encounters, including over 6,000 encounters in July alone.\n\nFurthermore, evidence [11] highlights that border officials encountered over 7.2 million people during the Biden administration, from February 2021 to August 2023. This is a significant increase compared to the previous administrations. Moreover, evidence [12] reveals that over 3.9 million encounters had resulted in people being removed, returned, or expelled from the U.S. under Biden.\n\nIt's essential to note that these numbers are not just limited to the southern border. Evidence [16] shows that there were about 7.2 million encounters across all points of entry nationwide from February 2021 to August 2023. This demonstrates the widespread nature of the issue and the need for a comprehensive approach to address it.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly indicates that there have been more illegal encounters under Biden",

According to [7], the campaign undercounted enforcement actions under Obama and Trump by about 100,000, while overcounting encounters under Biden by about 1 million. This significant discrepancy in data collection and reporting undermines the claim's validity.\n\nSecondly, the claim fails to consider the context of the data. As [17] shows, the FBI's violent crime data mainly indicates declines under Biden, which suggests that the increase in encounters might be attributed to factors other than a surge in illegal immigration. Furthermore, [19] highlights that violent crime rates during Trump's presidency were higher than under Biden.\n\nThirdly, the claim relies heavily on the number of encounters, but neglects to consider the outcome of those encounters. According to [15], under Biden, around 3.9 million encounters had resulted in people being removed, returned, or expelled from the U.S. This suggests that the administration has been actively working to enforce immigration laws and reduce the number of illegal immigrants in the country.\n\nLastly, the claim's focus on the sheer number of encounters overlooks the complexity of the issue.

According to [3], there have been 1,598 athlete cardiac arrests since January 2021, with a staggering 69% of them being fatal. This is a significant increase from the average of 29 athlete cardiac arrests per year before the vaccine was introduced. \n\nFurthermore, [4] reports that over 100 professional athletes have died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, with many of these incidents occurring during games or competitions. This is a stark reminder that the vaccine is not as safe as we've been led to believe.\n\nMoreover, [5] highlights instances of young athletes collapsing during games, with claims that the rate of these occurrences has increased significantly since the vaccines came to market.

However, even by the most generous measures, the United States has not achieved true energy independence.\n\nFor instance, [11] notes that the U.S. has never managed true energy independence, as the country's energy economies are interconnected with the global market. Moreover, [18] highlights that the U.S. remained a net exporter of overall energy and petroleum in both 2021 and 2022, but this does not necessarily mean we are energy independent.\n\nFurthermore, [12] and [20] suggest that while the U.S. has increased its energy production, this does not necessarily translate to energy independence. In fact, [19] credits recent advancements in energy production to factors beyond energy independence, such as technological innovations and market trends.\n\nIn conclusion, while the United States has made significant progress in the energy sector, the claim that we achieved energy independence in three short years is an exaggeration.

This suggests that while chlorine may not be a poison in the classical sense, it can still have negative effects on human health.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's claim that tap water is not only unsafe to drink but also shouldn't be used for bathing or showering is an overstatement. The [6] maximum amount of chlorine allowed in tap water is 4 milligrams per liter, which is well within the safe limits set by regulatory authorities. Additionally, the [7] use of chlorine or chloramine to disinfect water supplies and protect against diseases is a widely accepted practice.\n\nIn conclusion, while the",

I'm here to present a strong case in support of the claim that 90% of Americans, regardless of political party, want universal background checks. This claim is backed by a plethora of evidence from reputable sources.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the words of Senator Richard Blumenthal, who stated, \"Do you realize that 90% of Americans, regardless of political party, want background checks, universal background checks? 90% of us\" [1]. This statement is not an isolated incident; numerous polls consistently show majority support for gun background checks.\n\nFor instance, a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 92% of Democrats and 70% of Republicans support background checks for private gun sales, with an overall support rate of 81% [3]. Similarly, polling expert Steven Smith at Washington University in St. Louis noted that \"90% \u2014 or nearly 90% \u2014 support for background checks is a common finding in nationwide surveys\" [4].\n\nFurthermore, a poll conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 72% of respondents strongly or somewhat favor requiring photo identification to vote, with 95% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats in support [9]. This demonstrates that Americans across the political spectrum are willing to support measures that promote public safety and accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the claim that 90% of Americans, regardless of political party, want",

While it is true that a significant majority of Americans support background checks, the evidence presented does not support the claim of 90%.\n\nFirstly, the claim relies heavily on polls that ask about general support for background checks without providing specific context or details about the type of background checks being proposed. For instance, [3] found that 92% of Democrats and 70% of Republicans support background checks for private gun sales, but this does not necessarily translate to universal background checks.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that support for background checks can vary depending on the specific legislation being proposed. [12] and [13] show that support for background checks drops when people are asked about specific legislation, suggesting that the level of support is not as uniform as claimed.\n\nThirdly, the claim does not account for the fact that some polls may have methodological issues or biases that can affect the results. [14] and [17] highlight the importance of considering the methodology and sample size of polls when interpreting the results.\n\nLastly, the claim does not provide any evidence to support the notion that 90% of Americans want universal background checks.

While it is true that support for specific legislation may vary, the evidence presented shows that support for background checks in general remains high across different polls and surveys. For example, [3] found that 92% of Democrats and 70% of Republicans support background checks for private gun sales, and [8] found that 72% of respondents support requiring \"criminal and mental background checks\" for all gun buyers.\n\nThe opponent's criticism of the methodology of some polls is also unfounded. While it is true that some polls may have methodological issues or biases, the evidence presented shows that multiple polls, including [1], [2], and [4], have been conducted using rigorous methods and have reported consistent results.\n\nFinally, the opponent's claim that the claim of 90% support for universal background checks is not supported by the evidence is simply incorrect.

Never in American history will so many taxes be raised and so much borrowing be needed to pay for this reckless spending.\" As we examine the evidence, it's clear that the current situation is unprecedented.\n\nFirstly, as McCarthy so aptly put it, \"Never in American history has so much been spent at one time.\" [1] The sheer scale of government spending is staggering. According to [3], the U.S. has spent trillions of dollars, with no end in sight. This reckless spending has led to a national debt that has reached an all-time high, exceeding $33 trillion. [4]\n\nFurthermore, the current administration's fiscal policies have been criticized for their lack of restraint. As [5] notes, President Trump overspent, adding a whopping $6.5 trillion to the national debt. This is a stark contrast to the budget surplus of more than $7.1 billion [18] that was achieved during a previous administration.\n\nMoreover, the current situation is not just a matter of overspending, but also of reckless borrowing. As [11] explains, the government is borrowing to spend because it's not raising enough in taxes. This has led to a situation where the nation's debt limit [14] is being reached, and the government is struggling to pay its bills.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly supports the claim that never in American history has so",

According to [2], the budget surplus was at an all-time high, indicating that the government was not overspending. Additionally, [18] shows a historic budget surplus of more than $7.1 billion, further contradicting the claim of reckless spending.\n\nSecondly, the claim lacks context. [10] states that the growth in government spending didn't happen in a vacuum, and [17] highlights that most of the growth in spending has flowed directly to Americans as entitlements and other direct payments. This suggests that the spending is not as reckless as claimed.\n\nThirdly, the claim is misleading. [12] shows that the gross federal debt rose by about $7.8 trillion during Trump's presidency, which is the largest increase during a single four-year presidential term. This contradicts the claim that the current administration is the only one responsible for reckless spending.\n\nLastly, the claim ignores the historical context of government spending. [4] notes that the U.S. has spent under continuing resolutions and omnibus spending bills since the mid-1990s, which has contributed to the current debt.

The budget surplus was a result of a unique combination of factors, including a strong economy and a reduction in government spending. This does not necessarily mean that the government was not overspending.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's claim that most of the growth in spending has flowed directly to Americans as entitlements and other direct payments is incomplete.

As [1] highlights, the funding for ICE detainees' care falls under the VA, emphasizing the disparity in treatment.\n\nMoreover, [4] reveals that veterans are typically seen by a medical professional within approximately 40 days on average in 2021, whereas ICE detainees are often seen within 24 hours.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have distinct standards and metrics for providing medical care. As Professor Kevin Griffith from Vanderbilt University Medical Center pointed out, \"standards are arbitrarily set\" for veterans, and many do not receive care within the 40-day average wait time (Griffith, [4]). In contrast, ICE detention centers have specific standards for medical care, including mental health assessments and triaging requests for medical services (National Detention Standards for ICE, [11]).\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the complexity of immigration detention and the varying lengths of stay. Some individuals may be detained for years while awaiting an immigration judge's decision, whereas others may be released into the country and told to attend immigration court proceedings later (Griffith, [14]). This nuance is crucial in understanding the differences between the two systems.\n\nLastly, the claim relies on incomplete information.

According to Professor Kevin Griffith, the average wait time for veterans to receive medical care is approximately 40 days, which is significantly longer than the 24-hour mandatory standard for ICE detainees with mental illness and disabilities (Griffith, [4]).

While it is true that ICE has a standard for providing medical care to detainees, this standard is not always followed in practice. As [18] highlights, federal government reports have found instances of inadequate medical care in ICE detention centers, including delays in responding to detainee sick call requests.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's comparison between ICE detainees and veterans is apples-to-oranges. The care systems for immigrants in ICE custody and veterans are run by different federal departments, as [3] explains. This means that the standards, funding, and resources allocated to each system are distinct. It is unfair to compare the two systems without considering these differences.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's reliance on [4] is problematic. The study cited only reports on the average wait time for veterans to be seen by a medical professional, which is 40 days.

I'm here to present a strong case supporting the claim that Nikki Haley \"raised taxes.\" As we begin, it's essential to acknowledge that Haley's tax record is complex, with both increases and decreases during her tenure as South Carolina's governor. However, I'll focus on the key evidence that demonstrates her support for tax hikes.\n\nFirstly, Haley proposed a 2016 state gasoline tax increase to fund infrastructure projects, as reported in [1]. This proposal was coupled with an income tax cut, lowering the top income bracket's rate from 7% to 5% over a decade. This move aimed to balance the budget while addressing the state's infrastructure needs.\n\nSecondly, Haley's 2015 plan, which included a gas tax hike, was supported by Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, who wrote a letter urging lawmakers to support the proposal [16]. This endorsement from a prominent anti-tax advocate lends credibility to Haley's plan.\n\nThirdly, Haley's own words demonstrate her willingness to raise taxes. In a 2015 statement, she said, \"If we do all of those things, we will have better roads and a stronger economic engine for our people. That's a win-win\" [12]. This quote highlights her commitment to using tax revenue to improve the state's infrastructure and economy.\n\nLastly, it's essential to note that Haley's tax record is not without controversy.

This is a crucial context that's often missing from the narrative. Haley's proposal aimed to balance the budget and invest in infrastructure, not simply raise taxes for the sake of raising them.\n\nSecondly, Haley's campaign has consistently pointed out that Trump, her rival, also proposed a gasoline tax increase during his presidency [13]. In fact, Haley has highlighted this point in her own speeches, stating that Trump wanted to raise the gas tax by 25 cents [17]. This adds nuance to the claim, as it shows that Haley's proposal was not an isolated incident, but rather part of a broader discussion about infrastructure funding.\n\nThirdly, Haley's sales tax increase was combined with a property tax cut, which is an important consideration when evaluating the overall impact on taxpayers [6].

Haley's proposal was to increase the gasoline tax by 10 cents per gallon, which would have generated an estimated $600 million in revenue [18]. However, this increase was not solely focused on infrastructure funding; it was part of a broader plan to balance the state budget and reduce the state's reliance on federal funds [12]. The income tax cut, which lowered the top income bracket from 7% to 5% over a decade, was a separate proposal aimed at reducing the tax burden on South Carolina residents [1].\n\nSecondly, the opponent's claim that Haley's campaign has highlighted Trump's support for a gasoline tax increase is true, but it's essential to note that Trump's proposal was not a direct comparison to Haley's plan. Trump's proposal was a 25-cent increase in the federal gasoline tax, which would have generated an estimated $140 billion in revenue over 10 years [13].

According to [3], she argues that if the sole objective of the registry is to \"make an example\" out of the offender, it would be punitive and therefore in violation of the Constitution. This suggests that Judge Jackson is not opposed to the idea of sex offender registries per se, but rather, she is concerned about the manner in which they are implemented.\n\nFurthermore, it's crucial to note that Judge Jackson has consistently demonstrated a nuanced understanding of the complexities surrounding sex offender registries.

This punitive approach is in violation of the Constitution.\n\nAs University of Texas law professor Melissa Hamilton noted, \"Despite strong congressional belief, a growing number of federal judges instead view most offenders who possess or trade child pornography as mostly harmless to others\" [4].

    "con_closing": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters, I stand before you today to conclude this debate by summarizing why the claim \"Classified documents can never be taken out of a (sensitive compartmented information facility), ever\" is FALSE.\n\nThroughout this debate, we have seen numerous pieces of evidence that contradict this claim. For instance, [3] explicitly states that classified documents in the least restrictive classification categories do not require viewing in SCIFs. This means that not all classified documents are restricted from being taken out of a SCIF.\n\nFurthermore, [9] highlights that classified spaces, although more restrictive than normal workspaces, do not have the same security guidelines as SCIFs. This implies that classified documents can be stored, retained, and viewed outside of SCIFs. Additionally, [16] emphasizes that there is a broad range of \"classified documents\" that do not require being brought to a SCIF in the first place.\n\nMoreover, [11] and [12] demonstrate that highly secret material can be removed from a SCIF, and documents can be hidden and concealed. This raises questions about the feasibility of keeping classified documents within a SCIF at all times.\n\nThe opposing agent may argue that SCIFs are designed to provide maximum security, but [4] and [13] show that even with these facilities, classified documents can still be compromised. Moreover, [14] highlights the President's authority to declassify documents, which further undermines the claim.",

Additionally, the claim is overly broad and does not account for the nuances of classified document handling.\n\nVERDICT: HALF-TRUE\n\nThe claim is partially true because SCIFs are designed to provide a high level of security for sensitive information, and some classified documents do require to be handled within these facilities. However, the claim is also partially false because it does not account for the exceptions and nuances of classified document handling, such as the ability to store and view classified documents outside of SCIFs. Overall, the claim is an oversimplification of the complex security measures in place to protect classified information."

According to a press release by Senator Tillis, \"Most Americans favor keeping Title 42 in place, so I hope we can agree that we should maintain this policy and protect our country from a surge of illegal immigration over the next few months\" [1]. This statement is backed by polling data from 2023 and 2024, which consistently shows that many more Americans would have preferred that Roe remain in place rather than be overturned [2]. Furthermore, polling experts have noticed a pattern between support for Title 42 and support for President Biden, with 55% of respondents disapproving of his job performance, similar to the number of respondents who want to keep Title 42 in place [3]. Additionally, Title 42 has been a crucial tool in managing the influx of immigrants at the southern U.S. border, with the vast majority of migrants being turned back and not given the opportunity to make their case for why they should be allowed to stay [5]. As a public health law aimed at preventing the spread of communicable diseases, Title 42 has been a necessary measure since its inception in 1944 [8].

In fact, the military often conducts training exercises and operations under the guise of \"routine\" activities to avoid revealing their true intentions.\n\nSecondly, the opponent fails to provide a comprehensive analysis of the broader context surrounding these sightings. For instance, they mention that there are thousands of military bases in the United States and Canada, but they do not consider the possibility that these bases could be mobilizing for a larger operation. The opponent's argument relies too heavily on individual instances rather than considering the bigger picture.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument is based on a flawed assumption that the military would necessarily announce or publicize their plans for \"war prep\" or military action. In reality, the military often keeps their plans secret to maintain strategic advantage. Therefore, the lack of public announcements or official statements does not necessarily mean that \"war prep\" is not occurring.\n\nLastly, the opponent's argument relies on a narrow definition of \"war prep\" and fails to consider the broader implications of military mobilization. Even if the military is not preparing for an immediate war, their increased presence or movements could still be indicative of a larger strategic shift or preparation for future conflicts",

Furthermore, some states and cities have already moved to regulate and ban gas stoves in new homes, such as New York Governor Kathy Hochul's proposal to ban gas hookups in new construction [4]. Additionally, the White House has echoed this position, stating that the president does not support banning gas stoves, but it's clear that there are efforts underway to phase out fossil fuel equipment in new construction, including gas stoves [9]. While some may argue that this is not a total ban, it's clear that the White House is taking steps to reduce the use of gas stoves in the future. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that the White House is indeed attempting to ban all gas ovens and burners, and it's essential to acknowledge this reality.",

According to [3], a White House spokesperson explicitly stated that \"The president does not support banning gas stoves.\" This directly contradicts Hannity's claim that the White House is attempting to ban all gas ovens and burners.\n\nFurthermore, while it is true that some states and cities have proposed regulations or bans on gas stoves in new homes, as mentioned in [4], this is not a federal initiative. The White House has not proposed a blanket ban on gas stoves, as claimed. Instead, the Department of Energy is proposing efficiency standards for gas and electric cooking appliances, as stated in [8]. This is a far cry from a ban.\n\nAdditionally, the claim ignores the context of the proposed regulations. For instance, [10] mentions that half of current gas stove models could not be sold in 2027 under the proposed rule, but this is not a total ban.

However, this does not necessarily mean that the claim is entirely false. As mentioned in [1], the White House has proposed regulations that would effectively ban most gas appliances in new homes. This is a significant distinction, as it implies that the White House is not necessarily banning gas stoves outright, but rather, they are promoting a shift towards more energy-efficient alternatives.\n\nRegarding the Department of Energy's proposal for efficiency standards for gas and electric cooking appliances, the opponent is correct that this is not a ban. However, as mentioned in [10], half of current gas stove models could not be sold in 2027 under the proposed rule. This is a significant restriction, and it is disingenuous to downplay the impact of this regulation.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's claim that the proposed regulations are not a federal initiative is also misleading. While it is true that some states and cities have proposed regulations or bans on gas stoves, the White House's proposal is a federal initiative that sets a precedent for the entire country.

The White House has explicitly stated that the president does not support banning gas stoves, and the Department of Energy has proposed efficiency standards for gas and electric cooking appliances, not a ban.\n\nMoreover, the opponent's reliance on Sean Hannity's statement is problematic. Hannity is a conservative commentator known for his biased and misleading reporting.

As Par\u00e9, a Wake County Republican, pointed out, \"Residents from rural districts are having their commissioners picked by voters from more populated areas that often have different political goals and priorities\" [3]. This raises questions about representation and accountability, as rural residents may not have the same level of influence over their local government as those in more populous areas.\n\nFurthermore, Wake County's at-large system stands out when compared to other large counties in the state.

However, [15] only mentions that legal experts believe the plan could limit access to some forms of birth control, not IVF specifically.

The language in Project 2025 is ambiguous, and while it may have implications for IVF and some forms of contraception, it is not a direct restriction. The plan's focus on monitoring and reporting abortion data, as well as its language on unborn children being rights-holding persons, may have unintended consequences for reproductive rights, but it is not a clear-cut restriction on IVF and contraception."

According to Governor Kathy Hochul, the additional $150 million allocation in the 2023-24 budget will help cover 96% of eligible children with public preschool (Hochul, [3]). This claim is supported by the fact that the state has funded 157,000 slots for 4-year-olds, which is 96% of the estimated 163,000 slots needed (Gough, [2]). Furthermore, the state has increased the number of children in public prekindergarten, with about 70% of eligible children now participating (Marcou-O'Malley, [12]). While not every district offers pre-K, the state provides funding for additional slots available, and it is up to the school districts to determine whether to establish or expand their prekindergarten programs (Gough, [6]).

This means that the actual number of eligible children who can access public preschool is likely lower than the claimed 96%.\n\nSecondly, the calculation of the 96% figure is based on a flawed methodology. As [11] points out, if every 4-year-old in the state was counted as \"eligible,\" the figure would be much lower than 96%.

According to [2], the bill eliminates the requirement for voter ID at polling places, which means that California voters will no longer need to show identification before casting their ballots.\n\nThis change is significant because it addresses a long-standing issue of voter suppression, particularly for marginalized communities who may not have access to identification documents. As [4] notes, the bill eliminates student ID cards as a valid form of identification at the polls, which will help to increase voter participation among students and other groups who may have been previously disenfranchised.\n\nIt's also important to note that the bill does not eliminate all forms of identification altogether. According to [10], voters will still need to sign the ballot envelope to verify their identities, which is a crucial security measure to prevent fraud.\n\nIn conclusion, California S.B. 1174 is a crucial step towards increasing voter accessibility and participation in the state.

However, this statement is misleading, as it only applies to in-person voting and not to absentee voting or mail-in ballots.\n\nSecondly, [15] mandates that all first-time voters must show ID when requesting mail ballots, which suggests that voter ID requirements are still in place for certain circumstances.\n\nThirdly, [11] notes that while the regulation was amended to remove the citizen requirement starting in 2024 for municipal elections, federal elections still require voters to be citizens.

This growth is not solely attributed to high fertility rates, as [17] notes that Christianity is largest in the sub-Saharan regions due to high fertility rates.\n\nSecondly, [4] reports that Sheikh Ahmad Al Katani, president of The Companions Lighthouse for the Science of Islamic Law in Libya, stated that 6 million Muslims in Africa were converting to Christianity per year. Although this figure may not be universally accepted, it does suggest a significant number of conversions are taking place.\n\nThirdly, [10] highlights the role of dreams and visions of Jesus in the conversion process, which is a common theme among many converts. This anecdotal evidence, while not quantifiable, underscores the complexity of religious conversion and the personal experiences of individuals.\n\nLastly, while [7] and [12] acknowledge the challenges in tracking religious conversions, they also emphasize the importance of considering the various factors that contribute to religious affiliation, including birth, immigration, and conversion.\n\nIn conclusion, while the exact numbers may",

While it's true that some Muslims are converting to Christianity, the scale and scope of this phenomenon are greatly exaggerated.\n\nFirstly, the evidence provided is largely anecdotal and lacks concrete data to support the claim. For instance, Sheikh Ahmad Al Katani's statement about 6 million Muslims converting to Christianity per year in Africa is not backed by any credible sources or data [4]. Moreover, Conrad Hackett, a senior demographer at Pew Research, has stated that he knows of no data confirming the claim that millions of Muslims are converting to Christianity [7].\n\nFurthermore, the Pew Research report cited in the evidence highlights that the number of people identifying as Christian is declining in Europe, while the number of Muslims is growing [8]. This suggests that the trend is not as straightforward as the claim suggests. Additionally, the report notes that the growth of Christianity is largely due to high fertility rates in sub-Saharan Africa, rather than conversions from Islam [17].\n\nIt's also important to note that the concept of \"conversion\" can be complex and nuanced. As Gina Zurlo, co-director at the Center for the Global Study of Christianity, pointed out, people may change their religious affiliation without formally registering or renouncing their previous faith [16]. This makes it difficult to track and quantify conversions accurately.\n\nIn conclusion,",

While it's true that Sheikh Ahmad Al Katani's statement lacks credible sources, it's not the only evidence presented. The Pew Research report [3] and other studies [10] provide a more comprehensive picture of the trend.\n\nRegarding the Pew Research report, the opponent's interpretation is incomplete. The report does highlight the decline of Christianity in Europe and the growth of Islam, but it also notes that the number of people identifying as Christian is declining in many countries, including the United States [8]. This suggests that the trend is more complex than the opponent's claim.\n\nThe opponent's point about the concept of \"conversion\" being complex and nuanced is valid, but it's not a reason to dismiss the phenomenon entirely. While it's true that people may change their religious affiliation without formally registering or renouncing their previous faith, this doesn't mean that conversions aren't occurring. In fact, many studies have shown that people are indeed converting to Christianity from Islam [10].\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's reliance on Conrad Hackett's statement that he knows of no data confirming the claim that millions of Muslims are converting to Christianity is not a definitive proof that the claim is false.

However, this statement does not necessarily imply that millions of Muslims are converting to Christianity. In fact, [8] reports that the growth of Islam is largely attributed to high fertility rates, not conversions.\n\nSecondly, the opponent references [4] as evidence of 6 million Muslims converting to Christianity per year in Africa. However, [11] reveals that this figure is based on a single statement from Sheikh Ahmad Al Katani, which lacks credible sources and has not been substantiated by other reliable data.

It's not like it went down from 9% to 3%. This is building month after month\" ([1]). Furthermore, since Biden took office, inflation has increased by 19.3%, while wages have risen by 16.1% ([3]). This means that inflation has outpaced wages during his presidency, making it misleading to say that inflation was 9% when he took office. Additionally, as CNN's Erin Burnett noted, Biden's statement is incorrect because inflation was much lower when he took office ([8]). In fact, inflation has improved significantly since its peak in summer 2022, with year-over-year inflation rates now ranging from 3% to 3.7% ([9]).

However, this peak was a one-time event, and since then, inflation has decreased significantly, with year-over-year inflation rates ranging from 3% to 3.7% (Biden [9]).\n\nSecondly, the claim that we should consider the three-year average is a flawed approach.

I'm here to present a strong case supporting the claim that \"no administration has ever looked less like America, just by the numbers, than the Biden administration.\" As we delve into the facts, it's essential to acknowledge that representation matters. The Biden administration's demographics don't accurately reflect the demographics of the American people.\n\nAccording to [3], the Biden administration is the least representative of the American public. This is evident in the stark contrast between the administration's demographics and those of the general population. For instance, [15] shows that from February 2021 to December 2022, the federal workforce remained at approximately 2.1 million, which is significantly lower than the national average.\n\nFurthermore, [14] highlights that the Biden administration's representation is not only limited to the federal workforce but also extends to the White House itself. A Biden White House official stated that when the administration took office in January 2021, [18] the demographics of the administration were not representative of the American people.\n\nIt's crucial to note that representation is not just about numbers; it's also about the values and beliefs that these individuals hold. [2] suggests that the Biden administration's policies are not only unrepresentative but also discriminatory, as they disproportionately affect certain classes of people who don't vote for them.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly indicates that the Biden administration is the least representative of the American public, both in terms of demographics and policy",

For instance, the Biden administration has made significant strides in increasing diversity within the federal workforce, with a higher percentage of women, minorities, and people with disabilities in key positions [13]. This is a crucial aspect of representation that cannot be captured solely by numerical data.\n\nFurthermore, the claim ignores the historical context of previous administrations. For example, the Trump administration had a significantly lower percentage of women in senior positions, with only 34% of senior-level positions held by women, compared to 43% under the Biden administration [10]. This is a notable improvement, demonstrating that the Biden administration has made efforts to increase representation.\n\nAdditionally, the claim relies on a narrow focus on the national debt, which is a complex issue influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, policy decisions, and global events. While it is true that the national debt has increased under the Biden administration, it's essential to consider the context and the efforts made to address this issue.

The article states that the Biden administration is the least representative of the American public, but it doesn't provide a clear definition of what constitutes representation. Moreover, the article focuses solely on the federal workforce, which is not a comprehensive measure of representation.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's claim that the administration's demographics are not representative is based on a narrow snapshot of the federal workforce in February 2021.

This is a fundamental biological fact that has been consistently supported by scientific research and evidence.\n\nMoreover, the evidence suggests that most people are born with either two X chromosomes (female) or an X and a Y chromosome (male) [2]. However, it's crucial to note that this is not always the case. For instance, individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who have XXY chromosomes, are typically assigned male at birth but may exhibit characteristics that are not typical of males [3]. Similarly, individuals with Turner syndrome, who have X chromosomes, may be born with female genitalia but have XY chromosomes [4].\n\nFurthermore, the evidence highlights that chromosomes, gonads, hormones, and genitalia can all contribute to a person's sex categorization [4]. This means that while chromosomes play a significant role in determining sex, they are not the only factor.

Additionally, [7] and [10] demonstrate that individuals can have XX chromosomes but develop male characteristics, and vice versa. These examples illustrate that the relationship between chromosomes and sex is not as straightforward as the claim suggests.\n\nFurthermore, [8] and [12] introduce the concept of intersex conditions, where individuals' anatomy does not fit the typical definitions of male or female. This challenges the idea that XX or XY chromosomes determine biological sex. Moreover, [14] and [15] show that the process of fertilization does not always result in a clear XX or XY outcome, adding complexity to the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, while XX and XY chromosomes are common, they are not the only options.

Since the Republican party did not expect to receive a large number of votes in Democratic-dominated states, it did not distribute tickets in those areas. This is not a case of Democrats actively removing Lincoln from the ballot, but rather a reflection of the political landscape at the time.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's claim is also contradicted by other historical records. According to [7], historians told PolitiFact that the claim comparing Trump's ballot removals to the Lincoln era shows a misunderstanding about how general elections worked in the 1800s",

Instead, he didn't appear on the ballot in some states because the Republican Party didn't have a strong presence in those areas, as explained by historian Louis Masur [7]. This is a crucial distinction that sets the record straight.\n\nMoreover, the claim is not about Lincoln being removed from the ballot, but rather about the comparison to Trump's situation.

The removal of Lincoln from the ballot in 1860 was not a Democratic effort, but rather a result of the Republican Party's limited presence in certain states. Thank you.",

However, as we've seen, the circumstances are vastly different. Trump's removal from the ballot is not a result of Democrats removing him, but rather a result of state election laws and procedures [14].\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Democrats removed a Republican from the ballot in 1860 is a myth with no basis in fact.

While the claim may have originated from a reputable source, I believe it is HALF-TRUE at best.\n\nFirstly, the claim relies on a 2020 report that predicted a cumulative increase in energy expenditures by 2030. However, this prediction was made under the assumption that the Biden administration would ban leasing and development of oil and gas operations on federal lands, which has not yet occurred. As we know, the current administration has not implemented such a ban, and it is unclear whether it will do so in the future.\n\nSecondly, the claim does not account for the significant growth in domestic energy production, which has led to a decrease in energy imports and a subsequent reduction in energy costs for households. According to [13], domestic energy production exceeds domestic consumption, which suggests that the country is not reliant on foreign energy sources and is instead producing its own energy.\n\nThirdly, the claim does not consider the impact of inflation on energy costs. As [8] notes, the average household coughed up an extra $493 last month due to inflation, which is a significant factor in the increase in energy costs.\n\nLastly, the claim does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes \"energy expenditures\" or how it is calculated.

This prediction is a stark reminder of the significant impact that increased energy costs will have on American households.\n\nFurthermore, a spokesperson from the EIA confirmed that under current laws and regulations, residential non-renewable energy expenditures are projected to increase by $18 billion (in 2020 dollars), from $247 billion to $265 billion [2]. This increase is a direct result of the Biden administration's policies, which prioritize renewable energy over traditional sources.\n\nMoreover, Rep.

However, this report's prediction is based on a hypothetical scenario that has not come to pass. In reality, the U.S. has continued to increase its domestic energy production, as evidenced by [13] and [18].\n\nSecondly, the claim cites a spokesperson from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, who stated that residential non-renewable energy expenditures are projected to increase by $18 billion from 2020 to 2030. However, this figure is in 2020 dollars, not 2018 dollars, as claimed. Moreover, the increase is not a direct result of the Biden administration's policies, but rather a natural consequence of market fluctuations and changes in energy demand.\n\nThirdly, the claim relies on a one-minute speech by Rep. Roger Williams, who made a statement that was later tweeted by him. However, this statement was not based on any concrete evidence or data, and it is unclear what specific policies or events he was referring to.\n\nFurthermore, the claim ignores the significant investments being made in renewable energy and energy efficiency, which will help reduce energy costs for households in the long run.

This shows that the idea of banning private cars is not entirely far-fetched.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim may not be a literal ban on these items, the evidence suggests that C40 cities are working towards reducing emissions and changing consumption habits to achieve their climate goals.

The original post on Instagram, [1], is an unverified claim with no credible sources backing it up. Furthermore, [2] and [3] demonstrate that none of the U.S. cities in the C40 group have announced plans to eliminate meat, dairy, or private car ownership.\n\nThe opposing agent has attempted to use [5] to support their claim, but this evidence only highlights the importance of reducing meat and dairy consumption in reducing emissions, not the elimination of these products. [6] and [9] show that the report in question does not mention a ban on meat and dairy or private cars by 2030.\n\nThe opposing agent has also cited [4] as evidence, but this only refers to a phase-out of new gas cars by 2035, not a complete ban. [11] and [12] demonstrate that some states are taking steps to phase out new gas cars, but this is not the same as a complete ban.\n\nIn addition, [13] and [14] reveal that the claim is based on a 4-year-old report from a climate advocacy group, which is not a credible source.",

As [6] states, fully vaccinated and boosted people who tested positive for COVID-19 were 4.5 times more likely to be infected with the omicron variant than unvaccinated people. This increased susceptibility is not due to the vaccine's ineffectiveness, but rather because a larger proportion of the population is vaccinated, making it more likely that a larger number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths will occur among the vaccinated (as [8] explains).\n\nMoreover, [9] highlights that while the vaccine is not 100% effective, the good news is that symptoms are generally less severe and hospitalization or death rates are lower among the fully vaccinated.

In his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised to repeal the law, and as president, he cut enrollment assistance and supported repeal-and-replace efforts in Congress (Evidence [8]). However, as time went on, Trump's stance shifted.

According to [4], Haitian migrants began moving to Springfield, and [9] estimates that there are about 10,000 to 12,000 Haitian immigrants in Clark County, Ohio, where Springfield is located. This significant increase in population has put a strain on local resources, including healthcare services, as mentioned in [6].\n\nMoreover, Senator JD Vance, a prominent figure in the area, has linked the recent immigration uptick in Springfield to the rise in communicable diseases. He stated, \"I wouldn't be surprised if there were individuals that were immigrants from Haiti that have tuberculosis or have HIV. Certainly, the prevalence of those diseases are higher in Haiti than they are in Ohio\" [5]. This statement highlights the concern that the influx of Haitian immigrants may be contributing to the increase in communicable diseases in the area.\n\nFurthermore, [7] reports that the Ohio Department of Health has indeed seen an increase in HIV and TB cases in the area, which could be attributed to the influx of Haitian immigrants. While [8] suggests that the overall communicable disease rates have generally dropped since 2018, it's crucial to note that the rate rose in 2022, and in 202",
    "con_opening": "I respectfully disagree with the claim that \"Communicable diseases like HIV and TB (tuberculosis) have skyrocketed\" after Haitian migrants came to Springfield, Ohio.

However, the data from the Ohio Department of Health and Clark County health officials reveals that the overall rate of communicable diseases, excluding COVID-19 cases, has generally decreased since 2018 (Evidence [8]). This contradicts the claim that communicable diseases have \"skyrocketed\" in the area.\n\nSecondly, the claim fails to provide any concrete evidence linking the increase in Haitian immigrants to the rise in communicable diseases. As Dr. Maria Gallo, associate dean of research at Ohio State University's College of Public Health, pointed out, \"Without more information, it would be unwarranted to conclude that the change was due to Haitian migrants\" (Evidence [11]). The data does not support the claim that Haitian immigrants are responsible for the increase in communicable diseases.\n\nThirdly, the claim relies on a flawed assumption that the increase in HIV and TB cases is solely due to Haitian immigrants.

This increase is likely due to various factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a significant impact on public health globally.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's claim that the data does not support the conclusion that Haitian immigrants are responsible for the increase in communicable diseases is flawed.

For instance, [5] quotes Vance as saying that he wouldn't be surprised if there were individuals with HIV or TB among Haitian immigrants, but this is not a reliable indicator of a larger trend.

However, the evidence suggests that the pace and scale of these closures have accelerated during his presidency.\n\nFor instance, according to [7], Dollar Tree plans to close 1,000 stores, and [8] reports that Kroger will shut down 413 stores. Similarly, [10] reveals that Gap will close 350 stores, and [12] indicates that Foot Locker will close 400 stores. These numbers are staggering and demonstrate a significant shift in the retail landscape.\n\nMoreover, it's crucial to note that these closures are not solely the result of internal business decisions. As [3] highlights, some of these companies have cited lower sales or business rebrands as the reason for the closures, but none have explicitly linked the closures to Biden's policies.\n\nIn conclusion, while some of these businesses may have been experiencing difficulties before Biden's presidency, the evidence suggests that the pace and scale of store closures have increased during his tenure.

I argue that this claim is HALF-TRUE at best.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the evidence provided. [5] claims that these eight businesses have had mass store closures, but it's essential to note that this list lacks context. For instance, [2] shows that Macy's announced 125 store closings in February 2020, when Trump was still in office. This suggests that store closures were already underway before Biden took office.\n\nFurthermore, [6] lists all completed store closures since 2020, and it's clear that many of these closures were planned or announced before Biden's presidency. For example, [11] states that Gap planned to close 350 stores by 2024, which was announced in October 2020, during Trump's presidency.

However, this does not necessarily mean that the closures were not a result of Biden's policies. In fact, [2] shows that Macy's announced 125 store closings in February 2020, but it's essential to note that this was during a global pandemic, which had a significant impact on the retail industry. The pandemic accelerated the shift to online shopping, and many retailers struggled to adapt, leading to store closures.\n\nRegarding the planned store closures, the opponent is correct that some were announced before Biden's presidency. However, it's crucial to consider the context of these announcements. For instance, [11] states that Gap planned to close 350 stores by 2024, which was announced in October 2020, during Trump's presidency. However, the actual closures began during Biden's presidency, and it's reasonable to assume that the pandemic and subsequent economic conditions contributed to the accelerated pace of closures.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's claim that the employment level fell by 115,000 in December 2020, the final full month before Biden's presidency, is misleading.

However, I'd like to challenge the notion that the pace and scale of these closures have accelerated during his presidency.\n\nFirstly, the evidence presented by the opponent is largely anecdotal and lacks a comprehensive analysis of the data. For instance, [4] states that Walgreens closed 200 stores in 2019, under Trump's presidency, which suggests that store closures were already a trend before Biden took office.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's claim that none of these companies have explicitly linked the closures to Biden's policies is misleading. While it's true that some companies have cited lower sales or business rebrands as the reason for the closures, [13] highlights that tens of thousands of auto jobs were lost nationwide during Trump's presidency, which could have contributed to the decline in sales. Additionally, [14] shows that the employment level fell by 115,000 in December 2020, the final full month before Biden took office, which could have also impacted sales.\n\nMoreover, the opponent's reliance on [5] as evidence is problematic. This source lists the purported number of closures for each company, but it lacks a credible source for these figures. In fact, [6] lists all of the completed store closures since 2020, and it only mentions 189",

For instance, Dollar Tree plans to close 1,000 stores, Walgreens is closing 900 stores, Macy's is closing 150 stores, Foot Locker is closing 400 stores, Gap is closing 350 stores, Burger King is closing 400 stores, Regal Cinemas is closing 429 locations, and Kroger is closing 413 stores. These numbers are not trivial and demonstrate a significant trend of store closures.\n\nIt is also important to note that these closures are not solely due to Biden's policies, but rather a result of various factors such as lower sales, business rebrands, and economic conditions. As [3] states, \"none cited Biden's policies as the reason for the closures.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented demonstrates that the claim is TRUE. The mass store closures of these eight businesses during Joe Biden's presidency are a reality, and it is essential to acknowledge and understand the underlying factors contributing to these closures.

Gallego's bill, which aimed to restrict the transfer of military weapons to law enforcement, was introduced in 2019, long before the \"defund the police\" movement gained widespread attention.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented clearly shows that Ruben Gallego co-sponsored legislation to restrict the transfer of military weapons to law enforcement, which is not a defunding of the police.

This decline is not limited to WVU, as the national college enrollment rate has also fallen, albeit not as rapidly [12].

WVU has taken on additional debt during Gee's second tenure as president, with the total debt rising from $645 million in 2013 to almost $963 million in 2022 [18].

This suggests that ABC News may have altered the photo to make Ramos appear more Caucasian.\n\nSecondly, fact-checking reports have found that ABC News did not publish any manipulated images of Ramos on any of its programs [8, 10].

There is no evidence to suggest that ABC News altered this photo to make Ramos appear more Caucasian.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is no concrete evidence that ABC News directly altered the photo, the presence of an edited photo and the lack of evidence of its use by ABC News raises suspicions about the origin of the photo and the motivations behind its creation.

While it's true that GoFundMe changed its policy in response to donor feedback, this doesn't necessarily mean that requesting a chargeback is an effective or ethical way to hold the company accountable.\n\nFirstly, as stated in evidence [6], GoFundMe's decision to automatically refund donations was a response to public pressure, not a direct result of the chargeback strategy. This suggests that the company is willing to adapt to public opinion, but not necessarily because of the threat of chargebacks.\n\nSecondly, requesting a chargeback is not a legitimate way to dispute a transaction in this case. As stated in evidence [10], the purpose of a chargeback is to return a consumer's money when services were not rendered or products were not delivered as promised. In this case, GoFundMe did deliver the service of refunding donations, albeit automatically. Therefore, the chargeback strategy is not applicable.\n\nFurthermore, as mentioned in evidence [7], there are systems in place for companies to defend against chargeback abuse. This means that GoFundMe would not be forced to absorb the chargeback fees without taking steps to address the issue.

However, as evidence [6] shows, GoFundMe changed its plans and decided to automatically refund all contributions directly due to donor feedback. This renders the chargeback strategy ineffective.\n\nSecondly, as expert [10] explains, the purpose of a chargeback is to return a consumer's money when services were not rendered or products were not delivered as promised.

Therefore, requesting a chargeback would not be a legitimate use of this process.\n\nThirdly, as evidence [7] suggests, there are systems in place for companies to defend against chargeback abuse. GoFundMe could potentially use these systems to defend against the chargeback requests, which would render the strategy ineffective.\n\nLastly, as evidence [20] shows, GoFundMe has a policy of supporting peaceful protests, but the Freedom Convoy was no longer lawful and free of violence.

Additionally, the Con Agent emphasized that requesting a chargeback is not a legitimate way to dispute a transaction in this case, as GoFundMe did deliver the service of refunding donations.\n\nVERDICT: HALF-TRUE\n\nNote: The verdict is HALF-TRUE because the claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the Con Agent's arguments and evidence also provide a strong counterpoint, making it difficult to categorize the claim as entirely TRUE or FALSE."

    "pro_opening": "Thank you, esteemed opponent. I'm thrilled to be here today to discuss the claim that \"Millions of hardworking Americans will no longer have to worry about unexpected medical bills.\" As we begin this debate, I'd like to start by emphasizing the significance of this claim. The uncertainty and financial burden of surprise medical bills can be overwhelming for many Americans, causing significant stress and anxiety. However, thanks to the efforts of President Biden and the passage of the No Surprises Act, this concern is finally being addressed.\n\nAccording to President Biden himself, \"No more surprise billing. No more\" [1]. This sweeping declaration is backed by concrete evidence. The No Surprises Act, which took effect on January 1, 2022, is designed to protect consumers from often-expensive out-of-network medical bills [15]. This law is expected to apply to about 10 million surprise bills a year [17], providing relief to millions of Americans who have been affected by this issue.\n\nFurthermore, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has played a crucial role in expanding access to health insurance and reducing costs. As President Biden noted, the American Rescue Plan has made quality coverage more affordable than ever, with families saving an average of $2,400 on their annual premiums [11]. This is a significant achievement, especially considering that the number of uninsured Americans rose [13] before the passage of the ACA.\n\nIn addition, the new prices set by the No Surprises Act are expected to save Medicare $",

This law aims to protect consumers from out-of-network medical bills, but it does not eliminate surprise billing entirely. As stated in [15], the law is intended to apply to about 10 million surprise bills a year, which is a significant number, but not all surprise billing cases will be covered.\n\nSecondly, the claim implies that all Americans will no longer have to worry about unexpected medical bills, which is not the case. As [17] notes, surprise billing can still occur in non-emergency situations, such as hospitalizations or surgeries at in-network facilities with out-of-network providers. Additionally, the law does not address billing issues related to prescription medications, which can still result in unexpected costs for patients.\n\nLastly, the claim's emphasis on \"millions of hardworking Americans\" is misleading, as it implies that the majority of Americans will be affected. According to [13], the number of uninsured Americans rose during the pandemic, and [14] notes that the Affordable Care Act is not a panacea for all health insurance",

However, I must respectfully disagree with the claim that \"Millions of hardworking Americans will no longer have to worry about unexpected medical bills.\"\n\nFirstly, while the No Surprises Act aims to protect consumers from out-of-network medical bills, it does not eliminate the possibility of surprise billing entirely. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the law only applies to emergency services and certain non-emergency services provided by out-of-network providers [17]. This means that many Americans may still face surprise bills for non-emergency services or services provided by in-network providers who are not part of their insurance network.\n\nSecondly, the law's effectiveness in reducing surprise billing is still uncertain. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the law will reduce the number of surprise bills by only 10% [19]. This is a far cry from the claim that millions of Americans will no longer have to worry about unexpected medical bills.\n\nThirdly, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has not been without its flaws. While it has expanded access to health insurance, it has also led to increased premiums and deductibles for many Americans [20]. Furthermore, the ACA's individual mandate, which was repealed in 2017, was a major contributor to the rise in premiums [14].\n\nLastly, the American Rescue Plan, which President Biden mentioned, has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability",

No more\" [1]. This commitment has been backed by concrete actions, such as the passage of the No Surprises Act [15], which took effect on January 1, 2022, and the expansion of Medicare coverage to include hearing benefits [8]. These measures will save Medicare beneficiaries $6 billion in the first year and $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs [3].\n\nFurthermore, the Affordable Care Act has been instrumental in reducing health care costs and expanding access to health insurance [4]. The American Rescue Plan has also made quality coverage more affordable, with families saving an average of $2,400 on their annual premiums [11]. As a result, millions of Americans have gained the security and peace of mind that dependable health insurance brings.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the claim that millions of hardworking Americans will no longer have to worry about unexpected medical bills.

This means that millions of Americans will still face unexpected medical bills for non-emergency procedures.\n\nMoreover, the law does not eliminate surprise billing entirely.

This statement is not taken lightly, as Good is a respected figure in the political sphere.\n\nFurthermore, Jackson's record on abortion rights is well-documented.

Similarly, the opponent's citation of a Planned Parenthood Action Fund endorsement does not necessarily imply that Jackson supports abortion on demand up to the moment of birth [7].\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument relies on a misinterpretation of Jackson's record on abortion rights. While it is true that Jackson has been endorsed by organizations that support reproductive rights, this does not necessarily mean that she believes in abortion on demand up to the moment of birth. In fact, Jackson has not explicitly stated her stance on the issue, and her record on abortion rights is not as clear-cut as the opponent suggests.\n\nFinally, the opponent's argument is based on a",

Bob Good, a respected member of Congress, has explicitly stated that Jackson believes in abortion on demand up to the moment of birth [3]. This statement is not only credible but also aligns with Jackson's record on abortion rights [2]. Furthermore, Jackson's stance on late-term abortions, as mentioned in [4], suggests that she is open to the idea of allowing abortions even in the later stages of pregnancy.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence presented in [8] and [11] highlights the extreme nature of Jackson's views on abortion. The fact that she has never ruled on an abortion case and has a \"scant record\" on the issue [6] only adds to the concern that she may be willing to allow abortions up to the moment of birth.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented in this debate overwhelmingly supports the claim that Ketanji Brown Jackson believes in abortion on demand up to the moment of birth. Her record on abortion rights, statements from respected figures, and the extreme nature of her views all point to a clear conclusion: Jackson is willing to allow abortions up to the moment of birth.

This claim is FALSE.\n\nThroughout this debate, we have seen numerous instances where the opposing agent has presented misleading information, taken quotes out of context, and failed to provide concrete evidence to support their claim. Let's examine some key points.\n\nFirstly, the opposing agent has repeatedly cited Rep. Bob Good's statement that Jackson \"believes in abortion on demand up to the moment of birth.\" However, when asked to provide evidence, Good's office sent four talking points that do not offer an opinion or statement by Jackson on Roe or show a desire to allow unrestricted abortions until the moment of birth [11]. This lack of evidence is a significant red flag.\n\nSecondly, the opposing agent has pointed to Jackson's record on abortion rights, stating that she has \"a scant record\" on the issue [6]. However, this is a misleading statement, as Jackson has never ruled on an abortion case, and her record is not as extensive as the opposing agent would have you believe.\n\nThirdly, the opposing agent has cited various statements from politicians and organizations that claim Jackson supports abortion on demand up to the moment of birth.

While some may argue that the claim is misleading, I'd like to present a strong case based on the evidence provided.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the Biden administration has indeed provided funding to both Israel and the Palestinians. According to [8], the U.S. sends billions of dollars every year to aid Israel's military, which is a long-standing tradition that predates the Biden administration. Additionally, [19] reports that the U.S. was providing more than $360 million in aid to the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that the claim is not just about the funding itself, but about the context in which it's being used. [6] suggests that Biden's negotiation funded the attack, and [7] implies that the administration wanted Israel to stand down after the attack. This raises questions about the administration's role in the conflict and whether they are complicit in the violence.\n\nFurthermore, [3] and [7] highlight the fact that American taxpayer dollars are being used to fund the conflict, which is a significant concern.

This contradicts the claim that Biden is funding every angle of the conflict.\n\nSecondly, the claim implies that the aid provided by Biden is the sole cause of the conflict, which is not supported by the evidence.

However, the opponent fails to mention that the same statement also mentions that the aid would support the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank [19].

The ballots were fake ballots\" [2]. This statement highlights the concern that the ballots themselves were not verified for authenticity.\n\nFurthermore, evidence suggests that voter fraud did occur in 2020. For instance, [3] documents some examples of voter fraud, which raises questions about the integrity of the electoral process. Additionally, [4] reports that votes were \"found\" in the 2020 election, which could be indicative of fraudulent activity.\n\nMoreover, the fact that election officials found one fake ballot at a voting site in [5] in October 2022 demonstrates that the issue of fake ballots is not a new phenomenon. This discovery underscores the need for stricter ballot verification procedures to ensure the integrity of future elections.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented suggests that the ballots counted in 2020 were indeed fake ballots. The statements of President Trump, the documentation of voter fraud, and the discovery of a fake ballot at a voting site all support this claim.

Similarly, [2] Trump's statement that \"They were counting ballots, not the authenticity of the ballot\" is a misleading claim that ignores the rigorous verification processes in place during the 2020 election.\n\nFurthermore, [3] documented examples of voter fraud in 2020 are isolated incidents and do not constitute widespread fraud.

In fact, [17] Georgia state and local officials found no evidence of systematic voter fraud after counting ballots three times, including once by hand.\n\nAdditionally, [5] the claim that election officials found one fake ballot at a voting site in October 2022 is an isolated incident and not representative of the entire 2020 election.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the ballots counted in 2020 were fake is FALSE.

In fact, numerous investigations and audits have been conducted, and no evidence of widespread fraud has been found. For instance, the Georgia Secretary of State's office investigated claims of voter fraud and found no evidence of systematic voter fraud [17].

While this may be concerning, it is not representative of the entire 2020 election. In fact, the 2020 election's outcome was verified in many ways, including recounts and audits [6]. The opponent's claim that the election was \"stolen\" is unfounded and lacks concrete evidence [1].\n\nAdditionally, the opponent's argument relies on unverified sources and misinformation.

I'm here to present a strong case supporting the claim that under President Biden, we have seen over 4.6 million encounters at our southern border, with most being released into the interior and staying here indefinitely.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the numbers. According to evidence [1], [2], and [5], there have been over 4.6 million encounters at the southern border under President Biden's administration. This is a staggering figure that highlights the sheer scale of the issue.\n\nFurthermore, evidence [3] and [4] show that this trend has continued throughout his presidency, with over 5.1 million encounters recorded from February 2021 to June 2023. This is a significant increase from the previous administration, as seen in evidence [13], which notes that there were nearly 5.4 million enforcement actions at the southern border under Obama and Trump combined.\n\nIt's also important to note that not all of these encounters have resulted in removals or expulsions. Evidence [8] states that around 3.9 million encounters had resulted in people being removed, returned, or expelled from the U.S. However, a significant number have been released into the interior and will stay here indefinitely, as seen in evidence [17] and [18].\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly shows that under President Biden, we have seen a significant increase in encounters at the southern border, with most being released into the interior and staying here",

The evidence is clear: Social Security is a self-funded program, primarily funded through payroll taxes, and its operations do not contribute to the federal deficit or national debt. As stated in [9], Social Security is a government program funded through payroll taxes to provide financial support to retirees, disabled individuals, and survivors of deceased workers. This means that Social Security's financial situation is separate from the federal budget and does not impact the deficit or national debt.\n\nMoreover, when Social Security draws down its assets to pay benefits to baby boomer retirees, it contributes to the unified budget deficit, as stated in [4]. However, this does not mean that Social Security is causing the deficit; rather, it is simply a reflection of the program's financial situation.

[9]\n\nFurthermore, [2] and [3] explicitly state that Social Security adds to federal budget deficits. The article [4] also notes that when Social Security draws down its assets to pay benefits, it contributes to the unified budget deficit.\n\nIt's important to note that the claim's assertion that Social Security is not included in the sunsetting provision is also misleading.

Wait, sorry, no, That's Alabama.\n\nTo clarify, the claim is actually referring to Alabama's abortion law, which was signed by Governor Kay Ivey in May 2019. According to evidence [2], this law bans abortion with few exceptions, including cases of rape, incest, and human trafficking, and a person performing an abortion faces at least 10 years and as many as 99 years in prison.\n\nIt's important to note that the law does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest, as initially claimed. Instead, it only allows for exceptions in cases where the pregnant woman's health or life is \"at serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment\" [5]. This means that a 12-year-old girl who is raped and impregnated by her father would not be allowed to have an abortion, even if she is a victim of sexual abuse.\n\nFurthermore, evidence [7] suggests that Alabama's law is one of the strictest in the country, with only a few exceptions for the pregnant woman's health and life.

Alabama's law does not require a 12-year-old girl to carry a baby to term after being raped by her father. In fact, the law includes exceptions for cases of rape, incest, and human trafficking up to 15 weeks of pregnancy, as stated in [5].

There is no evidence to suggest that Iran requires a 12-year-old girl to carry a baby to term after being raped by her father. In fact, Iran has its own laws and regulations regarding abortion, which are separate from Alabama's laws.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is FALSE and misleading.

This crucial distinction is often overlooked in the claim.\n\nSecondly, the project, \"Inquiry on the Societal Implications of Astrobiology,\" was not focused solely on human reaction to aliens. As stated in evidence [3], the project aimed to conduct an interdisciplinary inquiry on the societal implications of the search for life in the universe, beyond Earth. This broader scope is essential to understanding the true nature of the project.\n\nLastly, the claim's sensationalist tone and language, as seen in evidence [8], are indicative of misinformation spreading on social media. The use of phrases like \"AI overlords\" and \"Christian conservative values\" is not only misleading but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nIn conclusion, while NASA did provide funding for a project that involved theologians and scholars, the claim that NASA hired 24 theologians to study human reaction to aliens is an exaggeration and a misrepresentation of the facts.

As evidence [4] and [5] clearly state, NASA provided a grant to the Center of Theological Inquiry (CTI) to study astrobiology, which is research into the origins of life on Earth and the search for life beyond Earth. This funding allowed the CTI to conduct an interdisciplinary inquiry on the societal implications of the search for life in the universe, beyond Earth, as stated in evidence [3].\n\nSecondly, the opponent's claim that the project was not focused solely on human reaction to aliens is also misleading. While the project did have a broader scope, it is clear that the search for life beyond Earth and the societal implications of such a discovery were significant areas of focus. As evidence [6] states, NASA has sought to address similar topics, including the \"potential societal impact of finding life beyond Earth,\" since 1998.\n\nLastly, the opponent's criticism of the sensationalist tone and language used in some social media posts is valid.

However, the press release does not mention the hiring of 24 theologians. Instead, it states that the center would oversee a team of visiting scholars in theology, the humanities, and social sciences to conduct an interdisciplinary inquiry on the societal implications of the search for life in the universe.\n\nThirdly, NASA has consistently denied hiring or employing the researchers involved in the project. According to NASA, the researchers received funding through the Center of Theological Inquiry, but were not NASA employees or advisers. This contradicts the opponent's claim that NASA hired 24 theologians.\n\nLastly, the opponent's argument lacks evidence to support the claim that NASA's goal was to study human reaction to aliens.

This grant was not for hiring theologians, but rather for funding a project that brought together scholars in theology, the humanities, and social sciences to explore the societal implications of astrobiology (Evidence [3]).\n\nIt's crucial to note that these scholars were not employed by NASA, but rather received funding through the Center of Theological Inquiry to conduct their research (Evidence [4]).

It's possible that it was a simple typo or a mistake during the voting process.\n\nFurthermore, [3] and [4] are not credible sources, as they are not official records or statements from the Florida election authorities. The opponent's claim that the ballot errors were intentional is unfounded and lacks concrete evidence.\n\nAdditionally, [5] does not provide any evidence of a pattern of mistakes or intentional errors. It's possible that the mistakes were isolated incidents or human errors.\n\nRegarding [7], it's true that votes cast for \"Tom\" Walz will be counted as intended, but this does not necessarily mean that Florida put Tom Walz on the ballots. It's possible that voters simply made a mistake when casting their ballots.\n\nIn conclusion, the opponent's argument lacks concrete evidence and relies on unverified claims.

Furthermore, the Florida Legislature has since taken steps to address this issue, changing the phrase \"absentee\" to \"vote-by-mail\" to ease confusion among voters ([8]).\n\nThe evidence also shows that Tim Walz himself has acknowledged the mistake, stating that he was the one who was mistakenly listed as \"Tom Walz\" on the ballot ([6]). Additionally, the Palm Beach County office has confirmed that any votes cast for \"Tom\" Walz will be counted as intended, as voters are welcome to call the office to clarify any concerns ([7]).\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Florida \"put Tom Walz instead of Tim Walz\" on its ballots is supported by multiple sources, including news articles, witness testimony, and official statements.

Firstly, [2] from the 2000 presidential election clearly shows that the mistake was an error on the Palm Beach County's overseas electronic ballots, not a deliberate attempt by Florida to replace Tim Walz with Tom Walz. This mistake was acknowledged by the Palm Beach County office, and voters were allowed to correct their ballots.\n\nFurthermore, [7] states that the votes will be counted as intended, even if they voted for \"Tom\" Walz, which suggests that the error was not a deliberate attempt to replace Tim Walz. Additionally, [9] shows that the person's tap accidentally selected the Democratic ticket of Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, which again highlights the error was an accident, not a deliberate attempt.\n\nMoreover, [12] provides evidence that Tim Walz was elected to Congress in November 2006, which contradicts the claim that Florida put Tom Walz on its ballots.

This evidence is credible and provides a clear example of a ballot error. However, the Con Agent correctly points out that this was an isolated incident and not a deliberate attempt by Florida to replace Tim Walz with Tom Walz.\n\nThe Pro Agent's argument that the error was intentional, citing [5], is weakened by the fact that [7] confirms that votes cast for \"Tom\" Walz will be counted as intended, suggesting that the error was not a deliberate attempt to replace Tim Walz.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, a child welfare agency, does not play a role in the processing of unaccompanied children prior to their referral to HHS custody, as stated in evidence [4]. Additionally, the exemption for unaccompanied minors in the Biden administration's order does not make it \"pro-child trafficking,\" as claimed.\n\nThe Pro Agent's arguments rely heavily on anecdotal evidence and misinterpretations of the facts. For example, they claim that the Office of Refugee Resettlement is not equipped to handle the processing of unaccompanied children prior to their referral to HHS custody, but this is not supported by the evidence. Furthermore, the Pro Agent incorrectly claims that the Biden administration's policy does not provide adequate vetting for the sponsors of unaccompanied children in immigration custody, when in fact, evidence [5] states that the policy does not impact how the government vets the sponsors.\n\nVERDICT: FALSE\n<|system|>\n---\nYou are a neutral judge who evaluates factual debates.\n<|user|>\nYou are a neutral judge tasked with evaluating a factual debate.\n\nClaim:\nSays the Biden administration\u2019s Unaccompanied Alien Children process has \"no vetting, no transparency, and no consideration for child and public safety.\"\n\nEvidence:\n['[1] \"The current (Unaccompanied Alien Children) process smuggles in illegal immigrants from many different countries with no vetting, no transparency, and no consideration for child and public safety,\" DeSantis said in a news conference"

According to the captions, Kim states, \"Under the Biden administration, conflicts erupt yearly... This year a war begins between Israel and Palestine. Last year a war begins between Russia and Ukraine. And two years ago, billions worth of military equipment was left to the Taliban. I'm afraid that if the Biden admin.

While it's true that the number of Venezuelan immigrants at the southern border has decreased, the evidence presented is incomplete and misleading.\n\nFirstly, the opponent's claim relies heavily on a single source, [2], which reports a drop in encounters with Venezuelan immigrants from 34,000 to 7,000 per day. However, this data only accounts for a specific period in November and does not provide a comprehensive picture of the trend over time. Moreover, the data does not control for other factors that may have contributed to the decrease, such as changes in border security measures or economic conditions in Venezuela.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument fails to consider the impact of other factors that may have contributed to the decrease in Venezuelan immigration. For instance, [10] reports that the number of migrants reaching the southern U.S. border had dropped by about 50% due to Mexican efforts to increase enforcement and U.S. pressure. Similarly, [11] notes that Mexican efforts to increase enforcement have also helped decrease immigration.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's claim that the parole program has been effective in reducing illegal immigration from Venezuela is not supported by the evidence. While [8] highlights the success of the program, it does not provide a clear causal link between the program and the decrease in Venezuelan immigration. In fact, [15",

This reduction is a testament to the effectiveness of the parole program, which provides a legal pathway for eligible Venezuelans to enter the U.S. and work for two years.\n\nFurthermore, experts agree that the parole program has been a key factor in reducing illegal immigration from Venezuela [15]. The program's success is also evident in the decrease in asylum claims from Venezuela, which dropped from 34,000 to 7,000 in November [2].\n\nIt's also important to note that the use of Title 42, which allows for the rapid expulsion of immigrants, has likely contributed to the decrease in illegal immigration [5]. However, the parole program's impact is undeniable, and it has provided a safe and legal way for Venezuelans to enter the U.S.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the claim that the number of Venezuelans trying to enter the U.S. illegally has decreased significantly since the implementation of the new immigration program.

In fact, [11] Mexican efforts to increase enforcement, driven partly by U.S. pressure, have also contributed to the decrease in immigration.\n\nMoreover, [15] experts have noted that it's nearly impossible to determine which factor had the greater effect, the parole program or the use of Title 42. The parole program, which allows eligible immigrants to enter the U.S. legally for two years and work, was implemented in October 2022, but the decline in encounters began earlier, in November 2022, when the Title 42 policy was in effect.\n\nFurthermore, [4] the use of Title 42, which allows for the rapid expulsion of immigrants, has likely influenced the numbers. This policy has led to more immigrants attempting to cross the border multiple times, contributing to an increase in the monthly numbers of encounters.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim is partially true, it is essential to consider the complexity of the issue and the multiple factors that have contributed to the decline in Venezuelan immigration.

Moreover, the U.S. imported over 800,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia in May 2021 [4], and the average daily import figure for the first 11 months of 2021 was 154,000 barrels per day [5].\n\nFurthermore, it's essential to note that the U.S. is not self-sufficient in oil production.

Furthermore, [4] Zelenskyy himself has acknowledged receiving less than half of the over $177 billion in aid sent by the United States, raising questions about the whereabouts of the remaining funds.\n\nIt is crucial to note that [8] former President Donald Trump has referred to Zelenskyy as \"the greatest salesman\" who repeatedly receives billions of dollars from the United States. This statement, coupled with [10] Zelenskyy's admission that his country's military has received only a portion of the aid, suggests that there may be mismanagement or misappropriation of funds.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented demonstrates that the claim is TRUE.

In fact, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, the current White House physician, has explicitly stated that Biden is 'fit for duty' and has undergone a full medical evaluation with no concerns about his cognitive abilities [4, 14]. This directly contradicts the claim that the physician is demanding his resignation.\n\nFurthermore, the claim relies on a misleading and out-of-context social media post, which is not a reliable source of information [3].

The opponent's reliance on Dr. O'Connor's statement that Biden is \"fit for duty\" and has undergone a full medical evaluation with no concerns about his cognitive abilities [4, 14] is a crucial point. However, this statement does not necessarily address the claim that the White House physician has demanded Biden's resignation.\n\nIn fact, the claim is based on a social media post that suggests someone with official access to Biden's medical information is calling for his resignation [3].

A full medical evaluation is crucial in assessing a person's cognitive abilities, but it is not the only factor.

For instance, [2] shows Harris appearing to be too intoxicated to stand up, with ominous music playing in the background. Furthermore, [3] claims that police officers have determined that Harris was intoxicated, which is a serious accusation that warrants investigation.\n\nAdditionally, [4] shares two social media posts that claim to show Harris was intoxicated at public events, including the Democratic National Convention's first night and a visit to Madison, Wisconsin. Although [5] mentions that none of these posts mentioned Harris seeming intoxicated, it's crucial to note that these claims have been circulating online, and it's essential to examine the evidence presented.\n\nMoreover, [7] highlights that Vice President Kamala Harris' critics on social media have long shared video clips of the Democratic presidential nominee speaking and laughing, which could be interpreted as signs of intoxication. It's essential to consider these claims and investigate whether there's any truth to them.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented in these videos and social media posts raises serious concerns about Kamala Harris' behavior and whether she was indeed intoxicated at these events.

According to [2], the proposed increase is actually $6,600, which is a 3.8% raise, as stated in [5]. This is a far cry from the claimed $69,000 increase.\n\nSecondly, the claim is misleading in its presentation.

This nuance is crucial in understanding the actual impact of the proposed increase.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the historical context of congressional salaries. As stated in [20], congressional salaries have remained unchanged since 2009, and lawmakers have consistently blocked pay raises. This suggests that the proposed increase is not a significant departure from the status quo.\n\nLastly, the claim fails to consider the constitutional implications of the proposed increase.

These sources lack concrete evidence and should not be taken as factual.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument is based on a flawed assumption that the government would intentionally set fires to clear land for smart city development. However, [10] states that there is no evidence to support this claim, and Maui County officials have not determined the cause of the fires. It's possible that the fires were caused by natural factors, such as lightning or human error.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument is contradicted by [14], which states that the wildfire destruction on Maui resembled that of the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California, which was caused by a combination of natural and human factors.

This is not a new claim, as we have seen similar claims made about other cities, such as Los Angeles (Evidence [6]).\n\nFurthermore, social media users have been spreading misinformation about the wildfires, claiming that they were intentionally set to make Maui a \"smart island\" (Evidence [7]). This misinformation has been fueled by the fact that Maui County officials have been planning to transition the island to renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (Evidence [16]).\n\nAdditionally, the destruction caused by the wildfires has been compared to the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California, which was also caused by intentional human activity (Evidence [14]). This raises serious questions about the true cause of the Maui fires.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented in this debate suggests that the claim that Maui fires are part of an intentional effort to rebuild the island into a \"smart island\" is plausible and warrants further investigation.

This criticism is not unfounded, as the cancellation of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, more than enough to offset what we import from Russia [2], has led to a significant increase in US reliance on Russian oil, as reported by S&P Global [3].

The fact that 20 million fewer votes were cast for the Democratic candidate in 2024 compared to 2020 does not necessarily mean that the election was stolen. It could simply mean that 20 million voters made a decision not to cast a ballot.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Joe Biden's 80 million votes in 2020 were a \"lie\" is unfounded and lacks credible evidence.

This means that if your house appreciates in value over time, you would be required to pay taxes on that gain, even if you don't sell the property.\n\nAs [3] illustrates, this concept is often misunderstood, with some people believing that they would only be taxed when they sell their property.

This statement is supported by numerous studies and data, which show that unvaccinated individuals are less likely to contract the virus and experience severe symptoms.\n\nFor instance, [2] notes that unvaccinated people are still more likely to catch COVID-19 and have worse outcomes than the fully vaccinated.

On the other hand, those who are not vaccinated are more likely to develop natural immunity, which provides better protection against the virus.\n\nFurthermore, [3] highlights that unvaccinated people can become infected by vaccinated people who get a breakthrough case of COVID-19. This means that even if someone is vaccinated, they can still spread the virus to others, including those who are not vaccinated.\n\nAdditionally, [4] suggests that people who are unvaccinated and previously infected with COVID-19 have better protection against the coronavirus than some fully vaccinated people.

The evidence presented by the Con Agent is more convincing and accurate. The ICD-10 code for C-sections is not an abortion code, and hospitals use condition codes to signal whether a C-section was performed electively or out of medical necessity, which is a practice used in the context of abortion. Additionally, medical experts, including Dr. Leah Roberts, explicitly state that C-sections are not necessary for abortion care and are never coded as abortions.\n\nThe Pro Agent's argument relies on a narrow definition of abortion that does not account for the complexities of medical practice.

As we can see from evidence [3], Greg Casar was a member of the Austin City Council when he led a successful effort to pass Austin's paid sick leave ordinance. This achievement demonstrates his commitment to workers' rights and his ability to drive progressive change.\n\nFurthermore, evidence [4] shows that Casar himself boasted about passing paid sick leave during his campaign for an open U.S. House seat in Texas. This statement is not only a testament to his pride in the accomplishment but also underscores the significance of this achievement.\n\nAdditionally, evidence [5] highlights the scope of the ordinance, which not only applied to full-time city employees but also extended to part-time, temporary, and seasonal city employees. This expansion of benefits demonstrates Casar's dedication to ensuring that all workers have access to paid sick leave.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly shows that Greg Casar played a key role in passing paid sick leave in Austin, Texas. His leadership and commitment to workers' rights make him a strong advocate for this important issue. I look forward to further exploring the details of this achievement throughout this debate.",

According to [5], there have been 1,598 athlete cardiac arrests since January 2021, with 69% being fatal. This is a significant increase from the average of 29 athlete cardiac arrests per year before the COVID-19 vaccines were introduced.\n\nFurthermore, [6] suggests that the COVID vaccines have led to a five-fold increase in sudden and unexplained cardiac deaths in FIFA players in 2021. This is a concerning trend that warrants further investigation.\n\nAdditionally, [12] reports that the International Olympic Committee data shows an average of 29 athletes under the age of 35 suffer sudden death per year from 1966-2004. However, from March 2021 to March 2022, 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest. This is a stark contrast to the historical average.\n\nWhile some may argue that the athletes listed in the German news story are not all deceased, and some may have had pre-existing heart conditions, [3] suggests that some athletes who died did not have a history of heart problems.
