    "claim": "\"When you have unemployment below 4% and inflation above 4%, recession always follows within two years.\"",
    "evidence_full_text": [
      "[1] On June 17, Summers told Barron\u2019s that \"when you have unemployment below 4% and inflation above 4%, recession always follows within two years.\" (Summers used the same formula in an interview with NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" two days later.)",
      "[2] Meanwhile, this is before we factor in high inflation. We cross-checked the months of sub-4% unemployment with inflation rates and found that none of the five months in 2000 also had inflation above 4%.",
      "[3] Let\u2019s start by looking just at the periods when unemployment was below 4%. Since 1948, unemployment has been this low only on four general occasions.",
      "[4] Under my plan, unemployment has been under 4% for two full years now, and inflation has been at the pre-pandemic level of 2% over the last half year.",
      "[5] We found only one clear example of Summers\u2019 rule holding \u2014 a two-year period in 1968 and 1969 when unemployment was under 4% and inflation was above 4%. That came in the immediate run-up to a recession.",
      "[6] Unemployment was below 4% for 35 straight months, from January 1951 to November 1953. It was also below 4% for 27 months from November 1967 to January 1970.",
      "[7] The longest stretch in which the unemployment rate was \"under 4%\" during Trump\u2019s tenure was 13 months, from February 2019 to February 2020, right before the coronavirus pandemic arrived in the U.S. and sent unemployment skyrocketing. That would be shorter than the streak under Biden.",
      "[8] Summers\u2019 premise \u2014 that there are a decent number of time periods when unemployment was below 4% at the same time inflation was above 4% \u2014 has problems from the start. In reality, there haven\u2019t been many such periods.",
      "[9] Currently, the unemployment rate is 3.6% and the inflation rate is 8.6%, so if Summers\u2019 rule is correct, then the U.S. should be facing a recession sometime in the next 24 months.",
      "[10] Unemployment has also been below 4% between mid-2018 and the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, and also from December 2021 to the present. But the pandemic recession was an oddity caused by an external factor, and it is this recent period of employment that Summers is using to predict the next recession, so it can\u2019t also be used as historic precedent.",
      "[11] Consider a comparison of the rates of inflation and unemployment from 2012 to the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Inflation ran in a pretty narrow range during that period, from effectively zero to 2.9%. Yet, over the same time span, unemployment ranged from 8.3% (a level rarely reached going back to 1950) all the way down to 3.5% (close to a record low).",
      "[12] In other words, during the nearly half-century from 1970 to 2018, there was not a single example of Summers' stated condition \u2014 unemployment under 4% and inflation over 4% \u2014 ever existing.",
      "[13] For the following two years \u2014 April 2021 to April 2023 \u2014 inflation rose faster than wages. That means real (or inflation-adjusted) wages were falling.",
      "[14] The state hit its lowest unemployment rate of 2.4% in April 2023.",
      "[15] Biden\u2019s saying \"below 4%\" made his statement correct. But by setting a 50-year timeline, Biden cordons off two earlier periods in which unemployment was below 4% for much longer.",
      "[16] There\u2019s a clear definition of a \"recession\" for the entire economy: A",
      "[17] Experts said that to get inflation under control we needed to drive up unemployment.We found a better way.Under my plan, unemployment has been under 4% for two full years now, and inflation has been at the pre-pandemic level of 2% over the last half year.pic.twitter.com/dJbcZa73VO\u2014 President Biden (@POTUS)February 4, 2024",
      "[18] So, before mid-2018, there were a grand total of five months since 1970 in which unemployment was under 4%. That's less than 1% of the months over the past half century or so.",
      "[19] In February 2024, the unemployment rate for native-born workers was 4%, which is low by historical standards and equal to the pre-pandemic average under Trump. The average rate during Biden\u2019s tenure has been only slightly higher: 4.2%.",
      "[20] So, counting the months the way Biden phrased it, the rate has been below 4% for 16 straight months, or at 4% or below for 18 months."

      "[6] Our World in Data provided a similar chart looking at per capita CO2 emissions for the same countries and time periods. The difference in this chart is that it shows not the percentage change, but rather the actual change in per capita emissions over time, measured in tons. This version of how the data is presented shows the U.S. and Japan leading in per capita CO2 emissions.",
      "[7] At the Senate hearing, Sullivan displayed a chart showing the change in carbon dioxide emissions in nine countries between 2005 and 2020. The U.S. stands out with a fall between those years of 970 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Japan\u2019s emissions went down 237 million metric tons. China, on the other hand, released an additional 4,689 million metric tons in 2020 than it did in 2005, while India\u2019s emissions rose 1,315 million metric tons.\nChart used by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to show carbon dioxide emission trends for nine countries. (Office of Dan Sullivan)\nSullivan\u2019s staff pulled these numbers from the website Our World in Data, a reliable resource based at the University of Oxford in England. The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019.\nThe first caveat to Sullivan\u2019s approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is \"conveniently misleading.\" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions.\n\"Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Jackson said.\nLooking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%.",
      "[8] Ritchie offered a simple explanation: Because China and India had very low levels of per capita emissions in 1990, when their economies were far less developed, their emissions have grown a lot since then. Readers wouldn\u2019t know it from this graphic, but the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan already had high levels of emissions, which didn\u2019t change very much over the same period.",

Viewed through that lens, despite the decline in U.S. emissions, the United States remained the larger emitter per capita.",
      "[11] In this case, China \u2013 the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases \u2013 plays a key role, particularly as it relates to some of the products being boosted by Bidens plan.",

    "evidence_full_text": [
      "[1] \"This has been a long-term project by the left. It actually began in the 1930s, and it came out of the KGB (the former Russian secret police agency). It was a KGB operation to destroy the country. And then after World War II, the Soviets actually changed their tactics. And what they decided to do, and it\u2019s been very effective for many decades, is infiltrate and grab control of the major pillars of U.S. life. They grabbed control of the culture \u2014 so entertainment, movies, television, music. They grabbed control of academia, at the university level and now it\u2019s all the way shot down through kindergarten and even younger. And they grabbed control of the news media.",
      "[2] We interviewed more than a dozen experts in the history of communist influence in the United States and they offered a unanimous answer: While the Soviet Union did seek to control major pillars of the United States, and while the USSR chalked up a few scattered successes decades ago in attracting support in the U.S., Crowley is flat-out wrong to say the USSR or China has ever controlled entertainment, education, or media, much less that they are doing so today.",
      "[3] Kevin Boyle, a Northwestern University historian and author of \"The Shattering: America in the 1960s,\" agreed. \"Soviet and Chinese communist governments \u2013 or any communist governments \u2013 never controlled American education, entertainment, or the media. To claim that was ever the case is not only false but absolutely ludicrous.\"",
      "[4] During a recent interview with Fox News, Monica Crowley, a conservative commentator and longtime foreign policy specialist, made a bold claim: Overseas communists have controlled key institutions of American life for decades.",
      "[5] The highest-profile battles involved Hollywood. In the 1930s and 1940s, \"there were Communist Party USA members and sympathizers who were writers, directors, and actors,\" said Victor Devinatz, a labor historian at Illinois State University. During World War II, some of these figures helped make films that were anti-fascist, at a time when the U.S. was allied with the Soviet Union, and films that had working-class themes, though the films did not explicitly advance communist politics.",
      "[6] \"The claim that Soviet and Chinese communists ever controlled or now control (such institutions) is nonsense,\" said Harvey Klehr, a retired Emory University historian whose books include \"The Soviet World of American Communism\" and \"In Denial: Historians, Communism and Espionage.\" Klehr is an adviser to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.",
      "[7] Experts were careful to distinguish between nefarious things that communists did accomplish in the U.S. and the notion that they ever controlled key American institutions.",
      "[8] The USSR also exerted influence over the (relatively small) Communist Party of the USA, said Jon Shelton, a University of Wisconsin-Green Bay professor and author of \"Teacher Strike!: Public Education and the Making of a New American Political Order.\"",
      "[9] \"Nearly all examples of communism in power came about through a violent revolution against the existing order and resulted in the abolition of private property, state takeover of the economy, one party, undemocratic rule, the crushing of dissent, and the loss of civil liberties and civil society institutions like a free press,\" Baruch College sociology and anthropology professor Ted Henken said.",
      "[10] Communism is the elimination of the market and private property and their replacement by an all-powerful, bureaucratic plan, Henken said. Communism seeks to establish a system of collective control over the means of production and resources.",
      "[11] In the 1950s, Sen. Joe McCarthy and other sympathetic members of Congress used hearings to root out communists from public life. Some 300 Hollywood figures who refused to cooperate \u2013 whether or not they were actual communists \u2013 were blacklisted from 1950 to 1960.",
      "[12] Communist Party influence in Chinese businesses",
      "[13] These include very large state-owned enterprises, which are closely connected to the government, and privately owned companies. The Communist Party has been trying to tighten its\u00a0 influence on private companies. For instance, since 2018 the party has required private companies listed on stock markets to have a Communist Party unit, said Deborah Brautigam, an emerita professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Advanced International Studies.",
      "[14] in 2023 that prevents Chinese Communist Party affiliates from buying farmland or land near Florida military bases and blocks the Chinese-owned app TikTok on government devices. Florida in 2021 also banned the Chinese Communist Party-funded Confucius Institutes at state universities and colleges. (The institutes taught Chinese language and culture.)",
      "[15] from the lawmakers, who said the Chinese government controlled ByteDance. Both Gallagher and Krishnamoorthi serve on the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "[16] \"With those pillars, they have been able to inflict tremendous damage over many decades. And now we are at a tipping point where the useful idiots on the left -- the Soviet Union collapsed, the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) stepped in to take over this grand project to destroy the country from within -- that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. And now when you have useful idiots in the highest levels of power, including in the White House, including in Congress, you\u2019re seeing an acceleration of the tipping point, to the point where we\u2019re almost at the point of no return.\"",
      "[17] A sharp increase in the number of Chinese immigrants on their way to the U.S. southern border with Mexico has led to baseless social media claims about a stealth invasion by the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "[18] in mainland China.) China is increasingly taking \"golden shares\" at China-based companies, giving the government board seats, voting power and a say in business decisions, the Journal reported.",
      "[19] Beyond Cuba, China and the former Soviet Union enacted large-scale nationalizations of private enterprise shortly after national revolutions, Henken said. Mao Zedong, chairman of the People\u2019s Republic of China, nationalized all private assets in the early 1950s and restricted private ownership.",

      "[2] Under Bragg, prosecutors downgraded a greater share of felony charges to misdemeanors than in recent history in Manhattan. In 2021, under his predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr., 47% of felonies were downgraded to misdemeanors. In 2020, when the city was strained by\u00a0COVID-19 quarantines and related judicial delays, that figure was 35%. It was 39% in 2019 and 40% in 2018.",

      "[7] But in the recent past, before Bragg took over, the rates of downgrading felonies to misdemeanors were higher in other New York City boroughs. Similar state data compiled by the Data Collaborative for Justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice shows that in 2021, the most recent year with available data, three other boroughs had higher rates: 56% in the Bronx, 57% in Brooklyn and 59% in Queens. (This data, which could have included a different set of cases, showed that in Manhattan in 2021, the rate was 52%.)",

The data does not signal\u00a0why prosecutors changed the charges, though experts told us this practice is not unusual.",

But as I said in the past and as you accurately quoted me, the default position should be to try as best as possible within reason to keep the children in school, or to get them back to school. The best way to ensure the safety of the children in school is to get the community level of spread low. So, if you mitigate the things that you know are causing spread in a very, very profound way, in a robust way, if you bring that down, you will then indirectly and ultimately protect the children in the school because the community level is determined how things go across the board.\"",
      "[2] The ad shows shortened clips of the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert making a series of back-to-back statements, each seemingly in opposition with the one prior:\n\"People should not be walking around with masks.\" \"Masks work.\"\n\"Fully vaccinated, you are protected and you do not need to wear a mask.\" \"If you are vaccinated, you should still wear a mask.\"\n\"You really better be very careful before you bring the children back.\" \"The default position should be to try as best as possible to keep the children in school.\"\n\"Right now, at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you're doing on a day by day basis.\" \"I would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see.\"",
      "[3] Context: This clip shows two words of a much longer answer Fauci gave in a June 12, 2020, interview with The Street. He also said masks weren\u2019t 100% effective and went on to discuss the need for physical separation.",
      "[4] Context: This clip is from Sept. 8, 2020, on \"PBS NewsHour.\" Fauci was speaking about K-12 schools and the rate of infection in the local community. He referred to green, yellow and red zones and cautioned about bringing students back too soon in communities in red zones.",
      "[5] Context: This clip from Nov. 29, 2020, on ABC News, edits out the words \"within reason\" that Fauci said after \"as best as possible.\" He was responding to a question in the context of New York schools closing and said there\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all approach to closures.",
      "[6] Context: This comment on Feb. 29, 2020, from NBC\u2019s \"Today\" show came after Fauci was asked if people needed to alter their daily lives because of the virus. Fauci said no, but the clip leaves out the context that he warned that this was subject to change if people started to see community spread.",
      "[7] Fauci\u2019s full comment: \"And then finally, if you\u2019re in the red zone, you really better be very careful before you bring the children back because you don\u2019t want to create a situation where you have a hyper-spreading event, as you might have in the school.\"",
      "[8] Context: This clip from a July 27, 2021, interview on PBS was edited to leave out that Fauci was referring to wearing a mask indoors. It also left out the important context that the CDC\u2019s mask guidance had changed in response to new data showing that vaccinated people with breakthrough infections could transmit the more highly contagious delta variant to others.",
      "[9] Context: The CDC had changed its guidance on masks in May 2021, saying that data showed it was safe for fully vaccinated people to stop wearing masks in most indoor or outdoor settings. In this June 29, 2021, clip from an interview with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt, Fauci was responding to concerns about the surge in delta variant cases and said that the CDC guidance on masks stood \"for now.\"",
      "[10] An 18-year-old video of Dr. Anthony Fauci talking about the strength of natural immunity is making the rounds on social media, with some users alleging the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is ignoring the science now when it comes to COVID-19.",
      "[11] \"You take an infectious agent and you introduce it into a population in which the spread among those individuals \u2014 if it\u2019s sexual-contact spread \u2014 it\u2019s a perfect set-up to spread,\" a decades-younger Fauci says in the video, which is labeled: \"AIDS/Dr. Anthony Fauci (NIH, 1984).\"",
      "[12] Context: This shortened clip of Fauci was from a March 8, 2020, interview on CBS\u2019 \"60 Minutes,\" three days before the World Health Organization designated the novel coronavirus a global pandemic. At the time, there was a concern about a shortage of personal protective equipment, called PPE, for health care providers. Officials at the time did not know that the virus could be transmitted by asymptomatic people. The CDC changed its guidance a month later, urging Americans to wear cloth face coverings. Fauci explained the change in mask guidance in an interview with PolitiFact on May 14, 2021.",
      "[13] Context: This March 15, 2020, clip from CNN is deceptively edited mid-sentence to make it seem Fauci was speaking broadly about personal interactions, when in reality he was answering a question from host \u200b\u200bBrianna Keilar about young people crowding into bars and restaurants, and whether he would like to see a national lockdown. He went on to say that young people were not immune to the virus, and that even if they were less likely to get seriously ill, they could transmit the virus to a more vulnerable person.",
      "[14] Fauci\u2019s full comment: \"The masks are important for someone who\u2019s infected to prevent them from infecting someone else. Now when you see people and look at the films in China or South Korea, whatever, everybody\u2019s wearing a mask \u2026 right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.\"",
      "[15] Fauci\u2019s full comment: \"No, right now, at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis. Right now, the risk is still low, but this could change. I\u2019ve said that many times, even on this program. You\u2019ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don\u2019t need to change anything you\u2019re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change, and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.\"",
      "[16] Fauci\u2019s full comment: \"So, when you have vaccinated people who might have a breakthrough infection, and we know now as the fact, as a scientific fact, that they can transmit the virus to an uninfected person, it's for that reason that the CDC made the change in recommendation, and did, just as you correctly stated, namely, that, if you are vaccinated, if you are (in) an indoor setting, you should still wear a mask.\"",
      "[17] A social media post misleads by showing a truncated version of a comment from Dr. Anthony Fauci that is missing context.",
      "[18] A close look at each of the statements shows Fauci was more nuanced and specific in his guidance than the selective editing in this ad would suggest. Here\u2019s a look at each of the Fauci statements used in the ad, with context:",
      "[19] Jones cherry-picked from Fauci\u2019s comments and distorted what Fauci said. In reality, Fauci was promoting boosters \u2014 along with a continued push to get the unvaccinated immunized \u2014\u00a0as a means to prevent continued surges in infection like the ones experienced as a result of the delta variant.",
      "[20] Fauci\u2019s statements were made in the context of an hour-long discussion about influenza, not COVID-19, the NIAID said in a statement to PolitiFact. Fauci supports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation that people who have recovered from COVID-19 still get vaccinated, the agency said."

Meanwhile,\u00a0 the sharpest increases at the pump have come since the start of war in Ukraine.",

Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan, which put more money into Americans\u2019 pockets when supply was spotty, intensified the increase in prices, as did Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The war sent U.S. gasoline prices to near-record highs."
