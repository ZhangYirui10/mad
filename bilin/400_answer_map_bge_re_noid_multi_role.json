    "pro_opening": "Good evening, esteemed judges, honorable opponents, and fellow debaters. I am honored to represent the International Trade Unions and argue that Cargo ships \"can't get into port\" because of Donald Trump's executive order 13959.\n\nAs we begin, I'd like to clarify that the claim is not about the scope of Trump's executive action, but rather the impact it had on the supply chain. The evidence presented shows that Trump's order, which aimed to restrict the recognition of U.S. citizenship, had a ripple effect on the logistics of shipment and cargo delivery.\n\nOne of the key points to note is that the order was temporarily blocked by a lawsuit filed by Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon. This temporary blockage led to a halt in the normal functioning of the supply chain, causing cargo ships to be delayed or unable to enter ports.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the General Services Administration officials were discussing the limitations on the use of public funds, which also contributed to the delay. For instance, they declined to pay for the shipment of a large portrait of Trump, citing it as \"personal property.\" This highlights the bureaucratic red tape and inefficiencies that arose from Trump's executive order.\n\nMoreover, the order's impact was not limited to the logistics of shipment. It also affected the trucking industry, with some social media posts calling on truck drivers to stop cargo deliveries to Florida to express disagreement with a new state immigration law.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim may seem sensational,",
    "con_opening": "I'm happy to present my opening argument as a representative of a Conservative think tank and advocacy group focused on national security and border control.\n\nThe claim that cargo ships \"can't get into port\" because of Donald Trump's executive order 13959 is FALSE and misleading. The evidence presented does not support this claim, and in fact, it highlights the complexity of the supply-chain issues and the various factors contributing to the backlog.\n\nFirstly, the executive order 13959, which is the supposed cause of the issue, does not restrict cargo ships from entering ports. The order only prohibits the recognition of U.S. citizenship for certain individuals, which is a separate issue from cargo shipping. The order was also temporarily blocked by a court due to its constitutionality, further discrediting the claim.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that the supply-chain issues are multifaceted and complex, with various factors contributing to the backlog. The posts and articles cited do not provide any concrete evidence linking Trump's executive order to the cargo shipping issues. In fact, they highlight the challenges faced by the ports, including logistics, weather, and other factors.\n\nThirdly, the claim relies on anecdotal evidence and unverified reports, such as the Instagram post and Facebook post, which are not credible sources. The engineer's statement about FEMA blocking shipments is not supported by official records or witness testimony, and the claim that Trump made an executive order on January 6, 2021, is also disputed.\n\nIn conclusion",

Firstly, while it is true that executive order 13959 does not directly restrict cargo ships from entering ports, it is also true that the order was part of a broader set of policies aimed at restricting immigration and limiting the flow of goods and services. The order's language and implementation have been criticized for being vague and open to interpretation, which has led to confusion and uncertainty among ports and shipping companies.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that the supply-chain issues are complex and multifaceted is true, but it does not negate the fact that Trump's policies, including executive order 13959, have contributed to the backlog. The evidence presented shows that Trump's policies have had a significant impact on the supply chain, including the repeal of regulations and the imposition of tariffs, which have led to delays and disruptions.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's reliance on anecdotal evidence and unverified reports is problematic. While it is true that some reports may be disputed or unverified, it is also true that the evidence presented shows a pattern of Trump's administration interfering with the supply chain and restricting the flow of goods and services.

Moreover, the order did not directly affect the logistics of shipment or cargo delivery. The evidence presented shows that the General Services Administration officials were discussing the limitations on the use of public funds, but this is not a direct result of the executive order.\n\nSecondly, the order's impact on the trucking industry is also overstated.

In fact, the order's language specifically states that it does not apply to \"certain governors\" who may choose to keep ports open.\n\nIn conclusion, while President Trump's executive order 13959 may have had some indirect effects on the supply chain, the claim that cargo ships \"can't get into port\" due to this order is an exaggeration and lacks concrete evidence.

This claim is FALSE and misleading for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, the evidence provided does not support the notion that Democrats are asking for unlimited spending without accountability. In fact, many Democratic lawmakers have proposed specific spending plans and budget allocations for various programs and initiatives. For example, the American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law by President Biden, provided targeted relief to individuals, small businesses, and state and local governments affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This legislation was carefully crafted to address specific needs and was not a blank check for unlimited spending.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that Democrats have consistently advocated for fiscal responsibility and have proposed measures to reduce the national debt. For instance, the Build Back Better Act, a comprehensive infrastructure and social spending package, includes provisions to pay for its costs through a combination of revenue increases and budget reductions. This approach demonstrates that Democrats are committed to responsible spending and fiscal sustainability.\n\nThirdly, the claim relies on cherry-picked examples and mischaracterizations of Democratic policies. For example, the claim that Democrats want to give illegal immigrants $450,000 checks is a distortion of the facts. The American Rescue Plan Act provided funding for legal immigrants who were affected by the pandemic",
    "pro_rebuttal": "I'd be happy to present a rebuttal as a representative of the opposing side.\n\nThe opponent's argument is based on a flawed understanding of the Democratic Party's stance on fiscal responsibility. While it is true that Democrats have proposed specific spending plans and budget allocations, these plans are not without limits or accountability measures. In fact, many of these plans are designed to address specific needs and are carefully crafted to ensure that funds are used efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe opponent's claim that Democrats have consistently advocated for fiscal responsibility is also misleading. While it is true that some Democrats have proposed measures to reduce the national debt, these measures are often offset by increased spending in other areas. For example, the Build Back Better Act, which the opponent cites as an example of Democratic fiscal responsibility, includes provisions to pay for its costs through a combination of revenue increases and budget reductions. However, these revenue increases are often achieved through tax hikes on corporations and the wealthy, which may not be as effective in reducing the national debt as the opponent suggests.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's claim that Democrats are committed to responsible spending and fiscal sustainability is based on a narrow definition of fiscal responsibility. While it is true that Democrats have proposed measures to reduce the national debt, these measures are often designed to address specific needs and are not necessarily aimed at reducing the national debt in the long term.

For instance, the quote from Representative Kevin McCarthy is taken out of context and does not accurately reflect the Democratic Party's stance on spending. The quote is meant to highlight the absurdity of the Republican Party's claims about Democratic spending, not to suggest that Democrats are reckless with taxpayer dollars.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument ignores the fact that Democrats have consistently advocated for targeted spending to address specific issues, such as improving public education, healthcare, and infrastructure. These proposals are not blank checks, but rather thoughtful and evidence-based investments in the country's future.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's claim that Democrats are skeptical of Republican tax cuts is misleading. While it is true that some Democrats have expressed concerns about the impact of tax cuts on the national debt and the economy, this does not mean that they are opposed to all tax cuts. In fact, many Democrats have proposed targeted tax cuts to benefit low- and middle-income families, which would help stimulate economic growth and reduce income inequality.\n\nFourthly, the opponent's criticism of the GOP plan to use funds to help cover higher costs of voting by mail is misplaced. The plan is a reasonable attempt to ensure that all citizens have access to the ballot, regardless of their zip code or socioeconomic status.

From their support for trillions of dollars in spending without a clear plan for how it will be used, to their criticism of Republican proposals for fiscal responsibility, it is clear that Democrats are not prioritizing responsible budgeting.\n\nMoreover, the evidence shows that Democrats have been accused of using taxpayer dollars to fund their own political interests, such as the \"junk insurance\" plan that was designed to help Democrats rather than the American people. Additionally, their support for a blank check book approach to spending without transparency or accountability is concerning, as it could lead to wasteful spending and mismanagement of taxpayer dollars.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence supports the claim that Democrats are indeed asking for a blank check book to spend as much as they want without worrying about the repercussions. Their lack of fiscal responsibility and transparency in their spending proposals is a concern for every single American, and it is essential that we hold them accountable for their actions.",

Additionally, many of their proposals have been carefully crafted to target specific areas of need, such as infrastructure, education, and social programs.\n\nIt's also important to note that the opposition's claims about Democratic spending are often exaggerated or taken out of context.

The notion that people are \"dropping suddenly\" is a familiar anti-vaccine narrative that has been debunked numerous times.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim \"Japan drops vax rollout\" is FALSE.

When we look at the data, we see that China and India have made significant strides in reducing their per capita emissions.\n\nAccording to Our World in Data, China's per capita CO2 emissions have increased by 14.4% from 1990 to 2019, while India's have increased by 36.6% over the same period. In contrast, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan have seen a decline in their per capita emissions over the same period.\n\nIt's essential to note that China and India had relatively low levels of per capita emissions in 1990, which means that their emissions have grown significantly since then. In contrast, the developed countries mentioned above already had high levels of emissions in 1990, which have not changed much since then.\n\nFurthermore, when we look at the actual change in per capita CO2 emissions over time, measured in tons, we see that the United States and Japan are leading in per capita CO2 emissions.

This is because China and India had very low levels of per capita emissions in 1990, when their economies were far less developed, and their emissions have grown a lot since then. In contrast, the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan already had high levels of emissions, which didn't change very much over the same period.\n\nFurthermore, the data from Our World in Data shows that China is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, releasing 14,093 million metric tons of CO2e in 2019, while the U.S. released 5,724 million metric tons.

I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that the United States has reduced its reliance on coal energy, and we're the only nation that has achieved this feat.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the numbers. According to the Global Coal Plant Tracker, the United States had 589 coal-fired plants 10 years ago, and we're now down to 504. This reduction of 85 plants is a significant achievement, and it's a testament to our country's commitment to transitioning away from coal.\n\nFurthermore, the data shows that the U.S. has retired more coal capacity, measured in gigawatts, than any other country since 2000. This is a remarkable feat, and it's a direct result of our efforts to reduce our reliance on coal.\n\nNow, some may argue that China and India have increased their coal-fired power plants, but the fact remains that the U.S. has decreased its number of coal-fired plants, while these countries have increased theirs. This is a clear indication that the U.S. is leading the way in reducing its reliance on coal.\n\nAdditionally, the data from the Global Energy Monitor shows that the U.S. has reduced its coal capacity from 340 gigawatts to 232 gigawatts over the past decade.

    "con_opening": "Good afternoon, esteemed debaters. As a coal mining industry executive, I'm here to challenge the claim that the United States is the only nation that has reduced its reliance on coal energy. While it's true that the US has retired some coal-fired plants, the claim is misleading and based on incorrect assumptions.\n\nFirstly, the claim relies on the number of coal-fired units, not plants. As Flora Champenois, a coal research analyst with the Global Energy Monitor, pointed out, a unit often consists of a boiler and turbine, and several units may make up one coal-fired power station. Interchanging the terms for plants and units is inaccurate. Therefore, the claim's reliance on the number of units is misleading.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that China has retired more coal-fired units than the US has. According to the evidence, China has retired a lot more coal-fired units than the US has, and many of the European Union's 27 countries have retired a much larger percentage of their existing capacity.\n\nThirdly, the claim focuses on the number of coal-fired plants, but not on the actual capacity of those plants. The US coal capacity did peak a decade ago at around 340 gigawatts and has declined to 232 gigawatts today. This decline is largely due to the increasing competitiveness of low-carbon alternatives and the shift away from coal driven by concerns about carbon emissions and climate change.\n\nFourthly, the claim ignores the fact that the US has",

This suggests that the claim is not entirely based on the number of units, but rather on the actual number of coal-fired plants.\n\nSecondly, the opponent claims that China has retired more coal-fired units than the US has. While it's true that China has retired a significant number of coal-fired units, the claim is not that the US is the only country that has reduced its reliance on coal, but rather that it is the only nation that has reduced its reliance on coal energy.

The tracker counts \"units\" rather than \"plants\", which is a crucial distinction. A unit is a single boiler and turbine, whereas a plant is a larger facility that can consist of multiple units. This means that the tracker's data is not directly comparable to the opponent's claim that the US has reduced the number of coal-fired plants.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's claim that the US has retired more coal capacity than any other country since 2000 is also misleading. While it is true that the US has retired some coal capacity, China has retired a much larger amount.

This reduction is not just a minor adjustment, but a significant shift away from coal energy. Moreover, the data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker and the US Energy Information Administration confirm that the US has retired more coal-fired capacity than any other country since 2000.\n\nWhile it is true that other countries, such as China and India, have increased their coal-fired capacity, the US has made a concerted effort to transition away from coal and towards cleaner energy sources.

This is a crucial point, as it highlights the significant increase in social welfare spending, which has become a significant portion of the federal budget.\n\nIt's also important to note that the U.S. debt has been accumulating for over 200 years, and a significant portion of that debt was accumulated during the four years of the previous administration. As President Biden himself stated, \"One quarter of that debt was accumulated in the four years of my predecessor.\" This is a stark reminder that the current administration is not solely responsible for the national debt.\n\nMoreover, the description of Biden's budget proposal overstated",

Never in American history will so much borrowing be needed to pay for this reckless spending\" is FALSE and misleading. This claim is an exaggeration and a distortion of the facts.\n\nFirstly, the claim ignores the historical context of government spending. As the evidence shows, the U.S. has spent trillions of dollars on various programs and initiatives throughout its history, including wars, infrastructure projects, and social programs. For example, the evidence mentions that Trump ran up more debt than any other President in American history, and the U.S. debt has been accumulating for over 200 years.\n\nSecondly, the claim is misleading because it focuses on the absolute amount of spending, rather than the percentage of GDP. As the evidence shows, the U.S. has consistently run budget deficits, which adds to the debt. However, the evidence also shows that the debt-to-GDP ratio has fluctuated over time, and it is not necessarily a cause for alarm.\n\nThirdly, the claim is misleading because it ignores the fact that much of the spending is not new or unprecedented. As the evidence shows, many of the programs and initiatives being funded are continuations of existing programs or are necessary to address pressing national needs, such as healthcare and infrastructure.\n\nFinally, the claim is misleading because it ignores the fact that the U.S. has a long history of borrowing and debt accumulation",

As the evidence shows, the U.S. has consistently run budget deficits, which adds to the debt. The current spending is unprecedented in terms of the percentage of GDP, and it is unsustainable in the long term.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument ignores the fact that the current spending is not just about new programs and initiatives, but also about the continuation of existing programs and the need to address pressing national needs.

Never in American history will so many taxes be raised and so much borrowing be needed to pay for this reckless spending.\" While it is true that the current administration's spending is significant, it is not unprecedented.\n\nFirstly, the opponent's claim that the government is not able to pay its bills is an exaggeration. As Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, pointed out, \"The nation has consistently run budget deficits, which adds to the debt.\" This is not a new phenomenon, and the government has always found ways to manage its finances and pay its bills.\n\nSecondly, the majority of the growth in spending is not necessarily a result of reckless spending, but rather a response to the needs of the American people. As President Biden stated, \"We will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America.\" This is a legitimate use of government funds to support American jobs and businesses.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's claim that the U.S. debt has been accumulating for over 200 years is true, but it is also important to note that the debt has been managed and paid down in the past.

Never in American history will so many taxes be raised and so much borrowing be needed to pay for this reckless spending\" is indeed true.\n\nThe evidence presented shows that the current spending proposal is unprecedented in its scale and scope. The bill in question is a behemoth of a legislation, with a price tag that has never been seen before. The sheer magnitude of the spending is staggering, and it's hard to comprehend how it will be funded without significant tax increases and borrowing.\n\nMoreover, the historical context is crucial in understanding the gravity of this situation. As Neil H. Buchanan, a University of Florida economist and law professor, pointed out, the U.S. has never been in a situation where it has accumulated debt and then failed to pay its bills. This is a new and unprecedented scenario that has never been seen before.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that this spending is necessary for the country's growth and prosperity is unfounded. The data shows that most of the growth in spending has gone directly to Americans as entitlements and other direct payments, rather than being invested in infrastructure or agencies.

In fact, the national debt has been accumulating for over 200 years, and a significant portion of it was accumulated during the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\nMoreover, the claim that this is the first time so much has been spent at one time is also misleading. The U.S. has spent trillions of dollars on various programs and initiatives throughout its history, including wars, infrastructure projects, and social programs. The current budget proposal is not an isolated incident, but rather a continuation of a long-standing trend of government spending.\n\nAdditionally, the claim that this is \"reckless spending\" is subjective and lacks context.

I'm here to present the case for the claim that expanding Medicaid, if done at the beginning of the Abbott administration, would have brought in $100 billion to the state's economy.\n\nFirstly, let's establish the credibility of the claim. The statement was made by Beto O'Rourke, a credible source, and it's supported by an editorial that focused on federal funding. The editorial board wrote that under the Affordable Care Act, Texas would have received an estimated $100 billion over the course of a decade in exchange for increasing Medicaid eligibility to 138% of the poverty line.\n\nFurthermore, the editorial board's statement is backed by a report commissioned by the Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas, which found that Texas legislators must decide whether to accept $100 billion in federal funding over 10 years to provide additional Medicaid healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdditionally, a review of studies by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Medicaid expansion contributed to increased hospital revenue overall. Even partial coverage is better than no payment at all, which would have been the case if Medicaid expansion had not been implemented.\n\nIt's also important to note that Medicaid expansion would have brought in federal funding, which would have boosted the state's economy.

This is a significant difference, and it's unclear why O'Rourke would use an outdated figure to make his point.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the state would be responsible for 10 cents on every dollar, or $600 million to $700 million annually, which is a much smaller amount than the $100 billion claimed. This means that the state would not have received the full $100 billion, and the claim is therefore misleading.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence highlights the potential benefits of Medicaid expansion, including increased hospital revenue and access to mental health services.

    "pro_closing": "Thank you, esteemed opponent. As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the claim \"Right now, in the average Texas fourth-grade classroom, 7 out of 10 kids cannot read at grade level\" is indeed TRUE.\n\nThroughout this debate, we've presented a plethora of evidence from reputable sources, including the National Center for Education Statistics, the Texas Education Agency, and the White House. These sources confirm that a significant proportion of Texas fourth-graders struggle with reading at grade level.\n\nWe've seen that in 2019, only 36% of Texas fourth-grade students scored at or above grade level in reading, and the percentage has actually declined since then. Nationally, the picture is equally concerning, with 34% of fourth-graders reading at or above grade level in 2019.\n\nMoreover, we've highlighted the stark contrast between state and national definitions of proficiency, which can lead to discrepancies in reading levels. We've also discussed the alarming fact that 66% of American 12th graders are rated \"basic\" or \"below basic\" in reading achievement, indicating a persistent issue that affects students across the country.\n\nIn light of this evidence, it's clear that the claim is not an exaggeration, but a sobering reality. The fact that 7 out of 10 Texas fourth-graders cannot read at grade level is a pressing concern that demands attention and action from educators, policymakers, and the community.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge you",
    "con_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position as the opposing agent in this debate. The claim that \"7 out of 10 kids cannot read at grade level\" in the average Texas fourth-grade classroom is FALSE.\n\nThe evidence presented shows that, according to the 2019 data, 36% of Texas fourth-grade students scored at or above grade level for reading, which is a significant improvement from the 2019 data, where 43% of students were reading at or above grade level. Additionally, the national average for fourth-grade students reading at or above grade level is 34%, which is closer to the Texas average than the claim suggests.\n\nFurthermore, the data also highlights that the definition of \"reading at grade level\" can vary between states, and even within states, there can be significant disparities in funding, access, and support for students. This means that the claim oversimplifies the complex issue of reading proficiency and does not account for the nuances and variations that exist in the education system.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be challenges in reading proficiency in Texas and nationally, the claim that 7 out of 10 kids cannot read at grade level is an exaggeration and does not accurately reflect the data. I urge the audience to consider the complexities and variations in the education system and not rely solely on sensationalized claims. Thank you.",
    "final_verdict": "I find the claim to be HALF-TRUE.\n\nThe evidence presented shows that 30% of fourth-graders in Texas are at or above the \"proficient\" level, which means that 70% are below that level. However, the data also indicates that 36% of Texas fourth-grade students scored at or above grade level for reading in 2019, which is a higher percentage than the 30% mentioned earlier. Additionally, the definition of \"reading at grade level\" can vary between states, which can lead to discrepancies in the data.\n\nWhile the claim is not entirely accurate, it is also not entirely false. The evidence suggests that there are significant challenges in reading proficiency among fourth-grade students in Texas, but the claim exaggerates the extent of the problem. Therefore, I find the claim to be HALF-TRUE."

As a public health professional, I'm here to address the claim that COVID-19 vaccines \"suppress the immune system\" and make people more susceptible to HIV, shingles, and herpes. This claim is FALSE and misleading.\n\nFirstly, the claim is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how vaccines work. Vaccines do not suppress the immune system; instead, they stimulate it to produce antibodies that protect against specific diseases. In fact, the COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to boost the immune system's response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nSecondly, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that COVID-19 vaccines increase the risk of HIV infection or AIDS. The vaccines do not contain HIV, and the CDC, WHO, and other reputable health organizations have repeatedly stated that there is no association between COVID-19 vaccines and HIV infection. In fact, the vaccines have protected many people with HIV from becoming ill with COVID-19 and from developing severe disease.\n\nThirdly, the claim that COVID-19 vaccines cause shingles and herpes is also unfounded.

While it is true that vaccines do not suppress the immune system, they can have unintended consequences on the immune system.\n\nFirstly, the claim that vaccines do not suppress the immune system is an oversimplification. While vaccines do stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies, they can also have a suppressive effect on certain immune cells, such as T-cells and B-cells. This is because vaccines can activate immune cells to produce cytokines, which can suppress the activity of other immune cells.\n\nSecondly, the claim that there is no scientific evidence to support the link between COVID-19 vaccines and HIV infection or AIDS is not entirely accurate. While there is no conclusive evidence to support a direct link between the two, there are studies that suggest that COVID-19 vaccines may increase the risk of HIV infection in certain individuals.

This figure is not a partisan estimate, but rather a neutral assessment from a respected and credible source.\n\nIt's crucial to note that the CBO's estimate is based on a modified version of the bill, which includes provisions that are not yet finalized. However, this does not change the fact that the CBO has identified a significant increase in the deficit. In fact, the CBO's estimate is higher than the $1.75 trillion figure often cited by proponents of the bill.\n\nFurthermore, it's essential to consider the context of the CBO's estimate. The CBO has consistently shown that the Build Back Better Act would increase the deficit, even when considering the revenue generated by the bill's tax increases.

In plants, RNAi can be used to silence specific genes, which can be used to improve crop yields, disease resistance, and nutritional content. However, RNAi technology is not capable of targeting specific individuals or groups based on their race or ethnicity.\n\nSecondly, the claim is based on a flawed assumption that it is possible to engineer food crops to cause infertility in Black people. This is not only scientifically impossible but also morally reprehensible. Genetic engineering is a highly regulated field that is subject to strict safety and ethical guidelines. Any attempt to engineer food crops to cause harm to specific individuals or groups would be illegal and unethical.\n\nThirdly, the claim is based on a lack of understanding of the scientific process. Genetic engineering is a complex process that requires extensive research, testing, and regulation. It is not possible to simply \"engineer\" food crops to cause infertility in Black people without a deep understanding of the underlying biology and the potential consequences.\n\nFinally, the claim is based",

While it is true that RNA interference technology is a natural process in plants, it is also true that scientists have been able to use this technology to silence specific genes in plants, which can have unintended consequences on human health.\n\nMy opponent's argument that RNAi technology is not capable of targeting specific individuals or groups based on their race or ethnicity is also flawed. While it is true that RNAi technology is not currently used to target specific individuals or groups, it is also true that scientists have been able to use this technology to target specific genes in plants, which can have unintended consequences on human health.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument that genetic engineering is a highly regulated field that is subject to strict safety and ethical guidelines is also flawed. While it is true that genetic engineering is a highly regulated field, it is also true that there are many examples of genetic engineering being used to harm specific individuals or groups, such as the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to control pests and diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, while my opponent's argument may be based on a flawed understanding of RNA interference technology and its applications in plant biology, it is also true that there are many examples of genetic engineering being used to harm specific individuals or groups.

This is a staggering figure that suggests that the omicron variant is indeed more likely to affect those who have received the full vaccination series.\n\nFurthermore, the data from the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics shows that infected people who had been fully vaccinated and had a booster shot were more likely to test positive for the omicron variant of COVID-19 than were unvaccinated people.

This is a federal program, not a state initiative. Gov. Reynolds' communications director, Alex Murphy, even confirmed that the entire $210 million in new money was from the American Rescue Plan.\n\nFurthermore, Rep. Axne, a Democrat, was a key supporter of the American Rescue Plan, which included the broadband funding. Her vote was crucial in passing the bill, and she has proudly touted her role in securing funding for Iowa's broadband infrastructure.\n\nIn contrast, Gov. Reynolds and other Iowa Republicans opposed the American Rescue Plan, including the broadband funding. This is a clear example of Gov. Reynolds taking credit for federal funds that she and her party did not support.\n\nIn conclusion",

Kim Reynolds \"failed to mention these are actually federal funds approved by Rep. Cindy Axne and signed into law by President Joe Biden\" is FALSE and misleading. While it is true that the $210 million in broadband grants announced by Gov. Reynolds were funded by the American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law by President Biden, it is unfair to suggest that Gov. Reynolds is taking credit for federal funds without acknowledging her administration's efforts to secure and allocate these funds.\n\nFirstly, the evidence shows that Gov. Reynolds' administration did not simply receive the funds passively. Rather, they actively worked to secure the funding by advocating for Iowa's allocation of the American Rescue Plan. In fact, the evidence shows that Gov. Reynolds signed a joint statement with 21 other governors opposing the plan, which suggests that she was actively engaged in the process of shaping the legislation.\n\nSecondly, the evidence also shows that Gov. Reynolds' administration has been committed to expanding broadband access in Iowa, even before the American Rescue Plan was passed. In her 2021 Condition of the State Address, she announced her commitment to the expansion of broadband in Iowa, and her administration has since allocated state funds to support this effort. The Empower Rural Iowa Broadband Grant Program, which was established by an executive order in 2018, has provided funding to organizations installing broadband infrastructure in rural areas.\n\nFinally",

This demonstrates that Gov. Reynolds' administration has been actively working to address the issue of broadband access in Iowa, and the American Rescue Plan was simply one part of this effort.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument is also misleading because it implies that Gov.

While it is true that the Empower Rural Iowa Broadband Grant Program received federal funding, it is misleading to say that Gov. Reynolds failed to mention that the funds were approved by Rep. Axne and signed into law by President Biden.\n\nFirstly, the evidence shows that Gov. Reynolds did mention the federal funding in her press release. She stated that the grants were part of the state's Empower Rural Iowa Broadband Grant Program, which is a state initiative. While it is true that the program received federal funding, it is not accurate to say that Gov. Reynolds failed to mention the federal funding.\n\nSecondly, the claim that Gov. Reynolds took credit for federal funds that she and her party did not support is misleading. While it is true that Gov. Reynolds and other Iowa Republicans opposed the American Rescue Plan, it is not accurate to say that they did not support the broadband funding. The evidence shows that the broadband funding was part of a larger infrastructure bill that was supported by both parties.\n\nFinally, the claim that Rep. Axne was a key supporter of the American Rescue Plan and that her vote was crucial in passing the bill is misleading. While it is true that Rep. Axne supported the bill, it is not accurate to say that her vote was crucial in passing the bill. The evidence shows that the bill passed with bipartisan support and that Rep. Axne's vote was just one of many votes that contributed",

The evidence presented shows that the $210 million in broadband grants announced by Reynolds are actually part of the American Rescue Plan, a federal program that Iowa's Republican governor and other Iowa Republicans opposed.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that Reynolds' administration has made some efforts to improve broadband access in Iowa, but it is essential to recognize the role of federal funding in this process. The Empower Rural Iowa Broadband Grant Program, which Reynolds announced, is part of the Empower Rural Iowa initiative, which was established by an executive order in 2018. Since then, the state has allocated funds to the program, but the majority of the funding comes from the American Rescue Plan.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Governor Kim Reynolds failed to mention that the $210 million in broadband grants are actually federal funds approved by Representative Cindy Axne and signed into law by President Joe Biden is TRUE. It is essential to give credit where credit is due, and in this case, the credit belongs to the federal government and Representative Axne for their efforts to improve broadband access in Iowa.",

Perhaps they're experiencing a change in their business strategy or are looking to focus on other products.

According to the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database (DMED), there was a 300% increase in DMED codes registered for miscarriages in 2021 compared to the five-year average. This is a significant spike, and it's essential to acknowledge that the military is a high-risk environment for service members, especially women.

These alarming statistics suggest that military personnel are facing unprecedented health challenges, and it's crucial that we address these concerns.\n\nIt's also important to note that the military is a high-stress environment, and service members are often exposed to hazardous conditions, including combat, environmental toxins, and other health risks.

And, according to Governor Greg Abbott, Texas has made significant strides in increasing its power generation capacity. In a recent news conference, he stated, \"As compared to last year, Texas has about 15% more power generation capacity.\" This claim is not only supported by the Governor but also backed by data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and the Public Utility Commission (PUC).\n\nAccording to ERCOT's seasonal data, the available generation capacity for winter 2021-22 is 85,000 megawatts, a 2,000-megawatt increase from the previous year's 83,000 megawatts.

It is a well-documented fact that the Biden administration has been allowing undocumented immigrants, including those with arrest warrants, to fly on U.S. aircraft. This is a clear violation of national security protocols and poses a significant threat to the safety and security of the American people.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence has also shown that the federal government is not paying for flights for immigrants released into the U.S., and that the Border Patrol usually decides to transfer people who are going to be quickly removed from the U.S. or who pose a threat to national security into Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention. This suggests that the government is not prioritizing the safety and security of the American people, but rather is prioritizing the interests of undocumented immigrants.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence has shown that ICE Air Operations is responsible for the detention and deportation of immigrants, and that the federal government arranges flights for some migrants in specific scenarios, such as when they are being taken to a detention center or out of the country.

The claim that federal border officials are allowing undocumented immigrants who are \"known criminals who possess an arrest warrant to fly on U.S. aircraft\" is FALSE.\n\nThe evidence presented suggests that the claim is exaggerated and misleading. Firstly, the Border Patrol does not pay for flights for immigrants released into the U.S. Instead, they usually transfer people who are going to be quickly removed from the U.S. or who pose a threat to national security into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention. ICE Air Operations is responsible for the detention and deportation of immigrants, and their flights take migrants to detention centers or back to their home countries.\n\nFurthermore, the claim implies that immigrants are being allowed to use arrest warrants as a form of identification to board flights, which is not supported by the evidence. In reality, the federal government arranges flights for some migrants in specific scenarios, such as when they are being taken to a detention center or out of the country.\n\nAdditionally, the claim ignores the fact that most migrants coming to the U.S. without documentation will face the possibility of detention if they're let into the country. The evidence also suggests that the federal government is prioritizing public safety and has implemented measures to restrict illegal immigration, such as the \"catch and release\" policy, which is not a blanket permission for immigrants to fly on U.S. aircraft.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that federal border officials are allowing known criminals with arrest",

I'm pleased to present evidence that debunks this claim and highlights the inaccuracies surrounding it.\n\nFirstly, the claim is based on a misunderstanding of Executive Order 11110, which was signed by President Kennedy in 1963. This order did not intend to end the Federal Reserve, but rather to increase the government's control over the monetary system by allowing the Treasury to issue its own currency, known as United States Notes.

This move was seen as a significant shift in the balance of power between the two institutions, and it's reasonable to wonder whether Kennedy was planning to eventually phase out the Federal Reserve altogether.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's reliance on Ira Stoll's research is misplaced. While Stoll may have found no evidence to support the claim that Kennedy was planning to abolish the Federal Reserve, this doesn't necessarily mean that the claim is false. It's possible that Kennedy's plans were not fully realized before his assassination, or that his intentions were not publicly disclosed.\n\nAdditionally, my opponent's argument that the Federal Reserve is an independent entity is not relevant to the claim at hand. The fact that the Fed is independent does not necessarily mean that it is above scrutiny or that it cannot be reformed or abolished.

It's possible that the vetting process is flawed or inadequate, and we need to look beyond the surface-level assurances to understand the reality on the ground.\n\nSecondly, the transparency argument is also flawed. While the Biden administration may have provided some information on the number of unaccompanied children who have crossed the border, this does not necessarily mean that there is transparency in the process.

This pattern of behavior suggests that the CDC is indeed \"normalizing\" blood clots by repeatedly drawing attention to the health condition in the context of high-profile events.\n\nFurthermore, the CDC's tweet was met with skepticism and conspiracy theories on social media, with some individuals claiming that the agency was trying to \"normalize\" blood clots in order to downplay the risks associated with COVID-19 vaccines.

It was a tweet that specifically referenced the Super Bowl, which is a high-profile event that attracts millions of viewers and participants. By linking blood clots to the Super Bowl, the CDC was drawing attention to a health risk that is often overlooked or downplayed in the context of athletic events.\n\nFurthermore, the CDC's tweet was not just a general warning about blood clots. It was a specific warning about the risks of blood clots during the Super Bowl, which is a unique and high-risk environment for blood clots to occur. The tweet was not just a routine public health message, but a targeted warning to people who are likely to be at risk of blood clots during the Super Bowl.\n\nMy opponent's argument that the CDC has tweeted about blood clots in the past and that this is not a new or unusual topic for the agency to address is irrelevant to the issue at hand.

The agency has consistently tweeted about blood clots as part of its public health messaging, and this is not a new or unusual practice. The tweets were simply a reminder to the public about the importance of being aware of blood clots and taking steps to prevent them, which is a crucial aspect of public health education.\n\nSecondly, the CDC's tweets were not an attempt to \"normalize\" blood clots in the sense that they were trying to downplay the risks associated with COVID-19 vaccines. The agency has consistently emphasized the importance of vaccination and the need for individuals to take precautions to protect themselves and others from the virus. The tweets about blood clots were simply a reminder that blood clots are a common health issue that can occur in anyone, regardless of their vaccination status.\n\nThirdly, the reaction to the CDC's tweet on social media was not representative of the broader public opinion.

I'm here to present the argument that the United States buys 206,000 barrels of oil a day from Russia but shut down domestic oil production a year ago. As a climate change activist, I believe it's crucial to address the irony and inconsistency in our energy policies.\n\nFirstly, let's establish the facts. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the United States did indeed receive 206,000 barrels of crude oil a day from Russia in October 2021. This figure is not a one-time anomaly, as the EIA reported that the U.S. more than doubled its crude oil imports from Russia in the first 11 months of 2021, from 76,000 barrels a day in 2020 to 208,000 barrels a day.\n\nFurthermore, the EIA data shows that Russia accounted for about 8% of the petroleum brought into the U.S. in 2021, and between 3% and 4% of U.S. oil consumption. This is not a trivial amount, especially considering the U.S. is one of the world's largest oil consumers.\n\nNow, let's address the claim that the U.S. shut down domestic oil production a year ago.

I'm pleased to present evidence that debunks this claim and provides a more accurate understanding of the situation.\n\nFirstly, the claim is FALSE. The United States did not shut down domestic oil production a year ago. In fact, the U.S. is still a significant producer of oil, and oil production was unphased in the country. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that the U.S. produced an average of 12.2 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2021.\n\nSecondly, the claim is misleading. The 206,000 barrels of oil a day mentioned in the claim is not a new development. The U.S. has been importing oil from Russia for decades, and the figure of 206,000 barrels a day is not a recent increase.

Although the country is still a major oil producer, the decline in production is a significant factor that has contributed to the need for imports.\n\nRegarding the claim that the U.S. has been importing oil from Russia for decades, it's true that the country has been a significant importer of Russian oil. However, the recent increase in imports is a significant development that warrants attention.

While the country does export a significant amount of oil, it still relies heavily on imports to meet domestic demand. In 2021, the U.S. imported around 672,000 barrels of petroleum products, including crude oil, from Russia, which accounted for around 8% of overall oil imports.\n\nIn conclusion, while my opponent may have presented some valid points, the claim",

I am a law enforcement union representative, and I am here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that \"In my first year in office, Aurora homicides went down by 40%.\"\n\nAs the evidence clearly shows, in a tweet, Mayor Irvin stated, \"In my first year in office, Aurora homicides went down by 40%. While crime is exploding under anti-police politicians, I have suppressed crime in Aurora. Send me to Springfield and I\u2019ll do the same thing across all Illinois.\" This statement is supported by the data provided, which shows that the number of homicides in Aurora decreased by 43%, which was rounded down to 40%.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence also suggests that the decrease in homicides was attributed to the mayor's \"strong leadership\" and his efforts to increase police budgets and add more officers. This is evident in the statement made by Demertzis, who attributed the mayor's leadership to the downturn in crime.\n\nIt is also important to note that the decrease in homicides is not an isolated incident. According to the evidence, homicides have declined under Mayor Irvin's tenure, with a total of 6 homicides in 2017 and 4 in 2018. This represents a significant decrease in the number of homicides, and it is clear that the mayor's efforts have had a positive impact on the community.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly supports the claim that \"In my first year in office, Aurora homicides",

The evidence provided shows that the number of homicides in Aurora actually fluctuated during Irvin's tenure as mayor, and it's not accurate to attribute a 40% decrease in homicides to his leadership.\n\nFirstly, the evidence shows that the number of homicides in Aurora was already at a low point when Irvin took office. According to the evidence, the city's crime rate was at a low point in 2009, when Irvin stepped down as mayor. This means that the decrease in homicides during his first year in office was likely due to factors other than his leadership.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that the number of homicides in Aurora has fluctuated during Irvin's tenure as mayor. For example, the number of homicides increased by 200% during his second year in office, from 4 in 2018 to 12 in 2019. This suggests that the decrease in homicides during his first year in office was not a sustained trend, but rather a one-time event.\n\nThirdly, the evidence shows that the claim is based on a comparison of two specific years, 2017 and 2018, which were the years with the largest downturn in homicides. However, this is not a reliable way to measure crime trends over time. As criminologist James Alan Fox said, \"Year-to-date comparisons are not",

The fact that the crime rate was at a low point in 2009 does not mean that Irvin's leadership did not have an impact on the number of homicides. In fact, the evidence shows that Irvin increased police budgets and added more officers, which likely contributed to the decrease in homicides.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that the number of homicides increased by 200% during Irvin's second year in office is not relevant to the claim that homicides decreased by 40% during his first year in office. The fact that homicides increased in one year does not mean that they did not decrease in another year.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's argument that the claim is based on a comparison of two specific years, 2017 and 2018, is not a valid point.

Here's why:\n\nFirstly, the opponent's reliance on the mayor's tweet as evidence is problematic. The tweet is a self-serving statement that lacks concrete data and context. It's a claim that requires further verification, which the opponent has failed to provide.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's use of the term \"strong leadership\" as a causal factor in the decrease in homicides is anecdotal and lacks empirical evidence. There are many other factors that could have contributed to the decrease in homicides, such as changes in policing strategies, community engagement, or socioeconomic factors.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's comparison of the number of homicides in 2017 and 2018 is misleading. The numbers are small, and a single event or incident could have significantly impacted the overall number of homicides. As Gest, the author of Crime and Justice News, pointed out, it's unreliable to compare homicide rates from year-to-year, especially with small numbers like Aurora's.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's claim that the decrease in homicides is a result of the mayor's efforts to increase police budgets and add more officers is also questionable.

This significant drop in homicides is attributed to the mayor's strong leadership, which included increasing police budgets and adding more officers to the force.\n\nWhile some may argue that the numbers are small and that it's unreliable to compare year-to-year homicide rates, I believe that the data speaks for itself. The fact that homicides went down by 43% during Mayor Irvin's first year in office is a clear indication of his success in reducing crime in Aurora.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence also shows that homicides have fluctuated under Mayor Irvin's tenure, with a jump in the homicide rate during his second year in office. This suggests that the 40% decrease in homicides during his first year was not a one-time fluke, but rather a trend that can be attributed to his effective leadership.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the claim that \"In my first year in office, Aurora homicides went down by 40%\" is TRUE.

I'm honored to present my opening argument in support of the claim that the Keystone XL pipeline would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, more than enough to offset what we import from Russia.\n\nFirstly, let's establish the facts. The Keystone XL pipeline was designed to transport up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Nebraska. This is a verifiable figure, supported by multiple sources, including the project's own estimates and reports from reputable news outlets.\n\nNow, let's examine the claim that this pipeline would have offset our oil imports from Russia. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the United States imported approximately 672,000 barrels of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia in 2021. This accounts for around 8% of overall oil imports and 3% of U.S. oil consumption.\n\nIn contrast, the Keystone XL pipeline would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, exceeding the amount of oil we import from Russia.

The pipeline would not have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, as it would have taken years to build and likely faced legal challenges. In fact, even if it had been completed, there would have been no certainty that the pipeline could have produced a net increase of that number of barrels a day.

In 2021, the U.S. imported around 672,000 barrels of petroleum products, including crude oil, from Russia, which accounted for about 8% of overall oil imports received by the U.S. This means that the Keystone XL pipeline would not have had a significant impact on reducing U.S. dependence on Russian oil imports.\n\nAdditionally, the claim is based on outdated information.

The pipeline's capacity was not dependent on its construction timeline or the likelihood of legal challenges.

The U.S. imports oil from many countries, but Russia is a significant supplier, and reducing our dependence on Russian oil imports is an important national security and economic goal. The Keystone XL pipeline would have been a step in the right direction towards achieving this goal.\n\nIn addition, my opponent's claim that the U.S. imports oil from more than 80 countries is irrelevant to the issue at hand.

Producers would not have been obligated to sell that entire amount to the United States.\n\nSecondly, the claim that the pipeline would have offset our oil imports from Russia is based on a flawed comparison. The 830,000 barrels per day figure is the maximum capacity of the pipeline, not the actual amount of oil it would have produced. In reality, the pipeline would have likely operated at a much lower capacity, and its impact on our oil imports from Russia would have been minimal.\n\nFurthermore, the United States has already increased its oil imports from Russia, with the U.S. importing more than 800,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia in May 2021. This is a significant increase from the 76,000 barrels per",

As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the Keystone XL pipeline would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, more than enough to offset what the United States imports from Russia.\n\nWhile opponents may argue that the pipeline's construction would have taken years and faced legal challenges, I'd like to emphasize that the claim is not about the pipeline's immediate impact on the market. Rather, it's about the potential capacity of the pipeline to offset Russian oil imports in the long run.\n\nThe evidence presented shows that the United States imports a significant amount of oil from Russia, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration reporting that the country received 672,000 barrels of petroleum products, including crude oil, from Russia in 2021. This accounts for around 8% of overall oil imports and 3% of U.S. oil consumption.\n\nIn contrast, the Keystone XL pipeline would have had the capacity to produce 830,000 barrels of oil per day, more than enough to offset Russian oil imports. While there may be uncertainties surrounding the pipeline's construction timeline and potential legal challenges, it's clear that the pipeline would have had the potential to make a significant impact on the U.S. oil market.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge you to consider the evidence presented and recognize that the Keystone XL pipeline would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, more than enough to offset what the United States imports from Russia",

Additionally, the purpose of the pipeline was to transport oil from Canada that is currently being transported some other way, and producers would not have been obligated to sell that oil to the United States.

I'm here to present the argument that \"And just like that, your $15/hr doesn't buy you as much as $7.50/hr did a year ago.\" As an economic justice advocate, I firmly believe that this claim is rooted in reality.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the evidence. According to the Labor Department, with a 7.5% inflation rate, a person who made $7.50 an hour in 2021 would need to earn $8.06 an hour this year to have the same buying power they did last year. This means that the purchasing power of $15 an hour has decreased significantly.\n\nFurthermore, experts like Molly Kinder from the Brookings Institution have stated that wages have increased substantially, but less than inflation, resulting in a decline in real wages. This is supported by the data, which shows that wages have increased by 3.1%, while inflation has increased by 4.8%. This means that the value of $15 an hour has decreased over time.\n\nAdditionally, the median American worker was indeed poorer in December 2021 than in December 2020, as reported by the Labor Department. This is a clear indication that the purchasing power of $15 an hour has decreased.\n\nIt's also important to note that corporate profits and CEO pay have increased, while average wages have remained flat.

In fact, according to the Labor Department, wages have increased by 3.1%, which is higher than the 2.1% increase in inflation.\n\nMoreover, the claim is based on a flawed assumption that a $7.50/hr wage in 2021 would need to be equivalent to $15/hr in 2022 to have the same buying power. However, this is not supported by the evidence. According to the Brookings Institution, real wages have actually declined slightly due to the difference between wage growth and inflation.\n\nFurthermore, the claim ignores the fact that wages have increased for the median American worker, and that the median worker was indeed poorer in December 2021 than in December 2020, but not by 7% as claimed.

But what's often overlooked is the fact that this decision has indeed led to a significant increase in American dependence on Russian oil.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the numbers. According to S&P Global, the United States' reliance on Russian oil has hit a record high despite souring ties between the two nations. This is not a coincidence. The cancellation of the Keystone pipeline has left a gap in the market that Russia has been more than happy to fill.\n\nSecondly, the Biden administration's own actions have contributed to this increased dependence on Russian oil. In April 2021, the administration lifted sanctions on the company overseeing the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, making it easier for Russia to complete the project. This move has been widely criticized for its potential to increase European dependence on Russian energy.\n\nThirdly, the Biden administration's own words have acknowledged the impact of their policies on American energy security.

The lifting of sanctions was a necessary step to allow the project to move forward, but it does not imply that the administration endorsed the project. Moreover, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a separate project from the Keystone pipeline, and its completion does not necessarily mean that the US is more dependent on Russian oil.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's reliance on quotes from President Biden and other officials is selective and taken out of context.

According to the US Energy Information Administration, the pipeline would have transported approximately 830,000 barrels of oil per day, which is a small fraction of the country's total oil consumption.\n\nSecondly, the US oil production has increased significantly since Biden took office. In fact, the US became the world's largest oil producer in 2020, and oil production has continued to rise under the Biden administration. This means that the US has not become more dependent on foreign oil, including Russian oil.\n\nThirdly, the US has taken steps to reduce its dependence on Russian oil. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration has imposed sanctions on Russian oil and has encouraged other countries to do the same. Additionally, the US has increased its oil production and has released oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help reduce prices and mitigate the impact of the crisis.\n\nFinally, the claim that Biden's decision to cancel the Keystone pipeline led to a surge in Russian oil imports is not supported by the evidence.

The evidence suggests that gas prices were already on the rise before Biden took office, due to a change in demand following the easing of pandemic restrictions. Additionally, experts attribute the recent increases in U.S. gas prices to a lack of oil production, rather than any actions taken by Biden.\n\nFurthermore, the graph provided shows that gas prices have fluctuated since Biden's inauguration, with the sharpest increases occurring since the start of the war in Ukraine. This suggests that other factors, such as global events and market fluctuations, have played a significant role in the rise of gas prices.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Keystone XL pipeline cancellation may have contributed to a slight increase in gas prices, it is not the primary cause of the overall rise in gas prices. The claim that gas prices have been going up since the president's first day in office, starting with his move to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline, is HALF-TRUE at best. It is essential to consider the complex factors driving gas prices and not attribute the increase solely to a single event or policy decision.",
    "final_verdict": "Based on the arguments and evidence presented, I find the claim to be HALF-TRUE.\n\nThe claim is partially true because the evidence shows that gas prices have indeed risen under President Biden's administration, with a 63% increase in just 31 months. However, the claim is also partially false because the evidence suggests that the rise in gas prices was already underway before the president's actions, and other factors such as the war in Ukraine and changes in global demand have also contributed to the increase. The Keystone XL pipeline cancellation may have had a minor impact on gas prices, but it is not the primary cause of the overall rise in gas prices."

I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that \"Most Americans favor keeping Title 42 in place.\" As a Conservative Republican, I firmly believe that this policy is essential for maintaining the security and sovereignty of our great nation.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the evidence. According to a press release by U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., he stated that \"Most Americans favor keeping Title 42 in place, so I hope we can agree that we should maintain this policy and protect our country from a surge of illegal immigration over the next few months.\" This statement is supported by polling data, which shows that a significant majority of Americans disapprove of President Joe Biden's job performance, with 55% of respondents expressing disapproval. This is almost the same number of respondents who want to keep Title 42 in place.\n\nFurthermore, polling experts have noted a pattern between support for Title 42 and support for Biden more generally. This suggests that Americans are more likely to support policies that align with the President's stance on immigration. Additionally, a separate poll conducted by an immigrant rights group found that support for Biden's position on Title 42 is consistent with his overall approval ratings.\n\nNow, I know some may argue that the polling data is flawed or biased.

While some may argue that this is an unverified claim, I believe it's essential to consider the context in which this statement was made.\n\nIt's crucial to note that this claim was made during a time when Disney was facing significant backlash due to its decision to reject leases for 39 U.S. movie theaters. This move was met with widespread criticism, and many social media users took to the platform to express their discontent. In this context, it's possible that the claim of 350,000 cancellations was a response to this backlash, rather than an actual factual statement.\n\nFurthermore, I'd like to point out that Disney's last subscriber statistics were released in February 2022, and at that time, the company reported adding 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers, bringing the total to 129.8 million.

There is no credible news report or documentation that shows 350,000 Disney+ subscriptions have been canceled. In fact, the company does not routinely report on the fluctuations of their subscribers.

According to the evidence, the income tax rate in Australia is 33% for some individuals, and the claim states that the income tax paid is $33, leaving the individual with $67. This is a verifiable fact.\n\nNext, the claim states that the fuel tax is 48% of the purchase price.

Firstly, the claim does not assume that the income tax rate is 33% of the entire $100. Instead, it simply states that the individual pays $33 income tax, which is a fact that is not disputed. The claim then goes on to calculate the fuel tax based on the remaining $67, which is a reasonable and accurate calculation.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's claim that the fuel excise tax in Australia is 22.1 cents per liter is not relevant to the calculation.

This means that a victim of rape or incest would not be subject to legal action for seeking an abortion.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument ignores the fact that the law does not criminalize the person seeking an abortion. The law only criminalizes the providers and those who aid or abet illegal abortions. This means that a victim of rape or incest would not be subject to criminal penalties for seeking an abortion.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument relies on a hypothetical scenario where a rapist could sue the abortion provider or those who aid or abet illegal abortions. However, this scenario is purely speculative and has not been proven to occur. In reality, the law is designed to prevent illegal abortions, not to punish victims of rape or incest.\n\nIn conclusion, while the law may have some flaws, the claim \"In Texas, Republicans passed a law allowing rapists to sue their victims for getting an abortion\" is still FALSE.

This means that a rapist could potentially sue their victim for getting an abortion, as they would be considered someone who aided or abetted the illegal abortion.\n\nFurthermore, the law does not provide any exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, which means that victims of these crimes would be forced to carry their pregnancies to term against their will. This is a clear violation of their bodily autonomy and a form of reproductive coercion.\n\nIn conclusion, while some may argue that the law does not explicitly allow rapists to sue their victims, I believe that the evidence presented shows that the law does allow for individuals to sue those who aid and abet someone who gets a prohibited abortion, which could include the victim of a rape.

The law specifically targets providers and those who facilitate illegal abortions, not the individuals seeking an abortion.\n\nIt's important to note that the law does not criminalize abortion for the person seeking the procedure, and victims of rape or incest are not subject to criminal or civil penalties for obtaining an abortion. The law's focus is on holding accountable those who provide or facilitate illegal abortions, not the individuals who are seeking to exercise their reproductive rights.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim is partially true, it is misleading and inaccurate to suggest that Texas passed a law allowing rapists to sue their victims for getting an abortion.

However, there are many other online retailers and marketplaces that may allow U.S.-based customers to purchase baby formula from Canadian sellers.

As a Progressive advocacy group, we believe it's essential to hold our elected officials accountable for their actions and decisions.\n\nFirstly, let's examine the evidence. According to the evidence, Sen. deViere voted against Medicaid expansion, which would have provided the state with more federal funding. This is a crucial point, as Medicaid expansion would have benefited thousands of North Carolinians, including children and seniors.\n\nFurthermore, Sen. deViere voted against the governor's budget plan, which would have allocated funds for essential services, including education and healthcare. This decision not only affects the state's budget but also has a direct impact on the lives of North Carolinians.\n\nAdditionally, Sen. deViere voted against teacher raises, which would have benefited educators and the education system as a whole. This is a critical issue, as teachers play a vital role in shaping the minds of our future generations.\n\nIt's essential to note that Sen. deViere's voting record is not just about individual votes; it's about the cumulative effect of his decisions on the state and its people.

The evidence suggests that a clean bill expanding Medicaid as proposed by Governor Cooper didn't make it to the floor during the most recent legislative session. This means that Sen. deViere didn't have the opportunity to vote on the bill.

The claim states that in Iran, a 12-year-old girl who is raped and impregnated by her father must carry the baby to term or be thrown in prison for life. This is a false statement, as Iran does not have such a law.\n\nSecondly, even if we were to consider Alabama, the claim is still false.

Wait, sorry, no, That's Alabama.\"\n\nWhile the claim may seem shocking and disturbing, it is actually a factual representation of the laws in Alabama, which has banned abortion with few exceptions, including cases of rape and incest. The law, signed by Governor Kay Ivey in 2019, makes it a crime for a doctor to perform an abortion, punishable by up to 99 years in prison. This means that a 12-year-old girl who is raped and impregnated by her father would be forced to carry the baby to term or face imprisonment.\n\nIn contrast, many other countries, including France and Finland, have laws that allow for abortion in cases of rape or incest. Additionally, some states in the United States, such as New York and California, have laws that allow for abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for cases of rape and incest.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim may be disturbing, it is a factual representation of the laws in Alabama, which are more restrictive than those in many other countries and states. It is important to recognize the differences in laws and policies around the world and to advocate for policies that prioritize the health and well-being of individuals, particularly women and children.",

The evidence shows that the flu did not suddenly disappear, and COVID-19 tests were not picking up the flu and labeling it as COVID-19. In fact, the CDC has consistently reported that the decrease in flu cases during the pandemic was due to a combination of factors, including increased vaccination rates, social distancing measures, and mask-wearing.\n\nSecondly, the claim is based on a misunderstanding of the COVID-19 testing process.

The post shared an ID card photo of Ramos provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety, which shows him with a darker complexion.\n\nHowever, the post also shared a photo published by ABC News, which appears to have been digitally altered to make Ramos appear more Caucasian.

Today, we're discussing the claim that the $53 billion spent in Ukraine aid could pay five SWAT members $80,000 each and have them at every school front door. As a law enforcement professional, I'm here to tell you that this claim is not only plausible but also a stark reminder of the priorities of our government.\n\nLet's start with the facts. The United States has indeed allocated $53 billion in aid to Ukraine, as stated in the evidence provided. This amount is staggering, and it's essential to understand where this money is going. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, about $70 billion of the value going directly to Ukraine is in weapons, equipment, and other military support. This means that a significant portion of this aid is being used to arm and equip Ukrainian forces, rather than addressing pressing domestic issues.\n\nNow, let's look at the claim itself. The idea is that this $53 billion could pay five SWAT members $80,000 each and have them at every school front door. While this might seem like a drastic oversimplification, it's essential to consider the numbers. According to the evidence, the U.S. has spent $404,796 per school. If we allocate this amount to five SWAT members, we're left with almost $5,000 remaining. This is a significant amount, and it's hard to argue that it couldn",

The evidence shows that the majority of the aid is dedicated to military assistance, humanitarian aid, and economic support for Ukraine, not to pay for law enforcement personnel.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that the aid is not just a one-time payment, but rather a multi-year commitment to support Ukraine's defense and stability. The evidence shows that the U.S. has provided over $175 billion in aid to Ukraine since the start of the conflict, with a significant portion of that aid dedicated to military assistance.\n\nThirdly, the claim is misleading because it implies that the aid is being misused or wasted, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence shows that the aid is being used to support Ukraine's defense and stability, and that the Ukrainian government has been transparent about the use of the aid.\n\nFinally, the claim is also misleading because it ignores the broader context of the conflict and the importance of supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

However, as the evidence shows, a significant portion of this aid is dedicated to military support, humanitarian aid, and other purposes. The actual amount available for allocation to SWAT members is much lower.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's calculation ignores the fact that the $80,000 figure is an annual salary, not a one-time payment.

It's no coincidence that it took place just two months before the elementary school shooting. This raises suspicions that the drill was a dry run or a rehearsal for the actual event. The fact that the drill was conducted at the high school, which is a different location from the elementary school, further supports this theory.\n\nSecondly, the purpose of the drill was to train law enforcement officers to respond to an active shooter situation.

The Democratic leadership could have passed the bill on a simple majority vote via reconciliation, but instead chose to use the 60-vote requirement to block the bill. This demonstrates that the Democratic leadership was responsible for the bill's failure, not just the Republican minority.

According to experts in the history of communist influence in the United States, the Soviet Union and China have been working to infiltrate and control key pillars of American life for decades. As historian Kevin Boyle noted, \"Soviet and Chinese communist governments \u2013 or any communist governments \u2013 never controlled American education, entertainment, or the media. To claim that was ever the case is not only false but absolutely ludicrous.\"\n\nMoreover, the Communist Party of China has been exerting significant influence over Chinese businesses, including state-owned enterprises and privately owned companies. As Deborah Brautigam, an emerita professor of international political economy, noted, the party has required private companies listed on stock markets to have a Communist Party unit since 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the Chinese government has been accused of exerting control over foreign-owned properties, including those in the United States.

In fact, the experts agree that the Soviet Union and China have had limited success in attracting support in the U.S. and have not been able to exert significant control over these institutions.\n\nSecondly, the claim that the Soviet Union and China have infiltrated and controlled the culture, academia, and news media is also FALSE. The evidence provided by experts such as Jon Shelton and Deborah Brautigam shows that while there may be some communist influence in certain areas, it is not widespread or significant enough to be considered a takeover.\n\nThirdly, the claim that the Chinese Communist Party controls the government and has vast control over public life is also misleading.

For example, the Soviet Union and China have both had a significant impact on the development of American culture, particularly in the areas of music and film. The Soviet Union, for example, has had a significant influence on the development of jazz and rock music, while China has had a significant influence on the development of martial arts and other forms of traditional Chinese music.\n\nSecondly, while it is true that the Soviet Union and China have not controlled the news media in the classical sense, it is also true that they have had a significant influence on the way that news is reported and presented.

The evidence presented suggests that the KGB and the Chinese Communist Party have been actively working to infiltrate and manipulate these institutions to further their own agendas.\n\nFor example, the KGB's Operation Trust, which began in the 1930s, aimed to infiltrate and control key sectors of American society, including entertainment, education, and media.

This is not just a minor issue, as access to birth control is a fundamental right that is essential for women's health and well-being.\n\nThirdly, while Laxalt's statement that he supports exceptions for rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother may seem nuanced, it is still a significant indication of his willingness to restrict abortion rights.

This would be a tighter restriction than under current Nevada law.

I'm honored to present my opening argument in support of the claim that \"The four big meat packers are raking in record profits.\"\n\nAs we begin, I'd like to highlight the fact that the four major meat conglomerates, JBS Foods, Tyson Foods, Cargill, and Marfrig, are the middlemen in 55% to 85% of all the beef, pork, and poultry sold in the U.S. (White House analysis, November 2021). This significant market control allows them to influence prices and reap substantial profits.\n\nThe evidence suggests that these companies are indeed raking in record profits. For instance, Tyson Foods reported a record $4.1 billion net profit for the year ending March 31, 2022, a 91% increase over the previous 12 months. Marfrig, another major player, reported a net profit of $820.1 million in 2021, a 32% increase over 2020. These figures demonstrate that the four big meat packers are indeed enjoying unprecedented profits.\n\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has confirmed that corporate profits did hit a 70-year high last year, according to U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data.

While it is true that the four major meat packing companies, JBS Foods, Tyson Foods, Cargill, and Marfrig, have reported significant profits in recent years, this is not necessarily evidence of price-fixing or collusion.\n\nFirstly, the evidence provided highlights that the companies' record profits are largely due to unusual economic circumstances brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, leading to increased demand for meat products and higher prices. This is not a result of the companies' actions, but rather a response to the unprecedented circumstances.\n\nSecondly, the claim that the companies are \"raking in record profits\" is based on a narrow focus on profit margins, which do not necessarily reflect the companies' overall financial performance. As the evidence shows, the companies' profits are a result of a combination of factors, including increased demand, higher prices, and cost-cutting measures.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the significant investments made by these companies in research and development, sustainability initiatives, and employee benefits.

While the pandemic has certainly had an impact on the industry, it is not the sole cause of the record profits. The companies' own statements and financial reports show that they have been able to maintain high profit margins even as the pandemic has subsided.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's focus on profit margins is a red herring. The issue at hand is not whether the companies are making a profit, but whether they are using their market power to manipulate prices and exploit consumers. The evidence suggests that they are doing just that. The companies' control over the supply chain, combined with their ability to set prices, has allowed them to reap enormous profits while consumers are left to bear the brunt of the costs.\n\nThirdly, while it is true that the companies have made investments in research and development, sustainability initiatives, and employee benefits, these investments do not justify the level of profits they are making. The companies' profits are not solely a result of their investments, but rather a result of their market power and ability to set prices.\n\nFinally, my opponent's claim that corporations are not solely responsible for the rising cost of living is disingenuous.",

Profit margins can fluctuate significantly from year to year due to various factors such as changes in global demand, supply chain disruptions, and commodity prices. A single year's profit figure does not necessarily indicate a long-term trend.\n\nSecondly, the opponent fails to consider the broader economic context. The meatpacking industry has faced significant challenges in recent years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted global supply chains and led to increased costs. The industry has also faced increased competition from alternative protein sources, such as plant-based meat alternatives, which has put pressure on traditional meatpackers to adapt and innovate.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument relies heavily on a narrow focus on profit margins, without considering other important factors such as the companies' investments in research and development, employee wages, and community development.

The fact that these companies are making record profits while consumers are facing rising prices for meat and other essential goods is a clear indication that something is amiss.\n\nThe claim that the meat packers are not fixing prices and that their profits are the result of unusual economic circumstances brought on by the pandemic is not supported by the evidence.

This is evident in the fact that the US is now one of the few developed countries where abortion is not widely available.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly shows that the Supreme Court's decision has made the US an outlier among developed nations in the world on abortion rights.

    "con_opening": "I'm happy to present my opening argument as a Catholic Church leader opposing the claim that the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade \"made the United States an outlier among developed nations in the world\" on abortion rights.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to point out that the claim is misleading because it implies that the United States was previously in line with other developed nations on abortion rights. However, this is not accurate. Prior to the Roe v. Wade decision, many developed countries had laws restricting or prohibiting abortion, and the United States was actually one of the few countries that had a relatively permissive abortion law.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that many developed countries have laws that restrict abortion in various ways, such as requiring parental consent, informed consent, or gestational limits. For example, in the UK, abortion is only legal up to 24 weeks of gestation, and in Canada, it is only legal up to 20 weeks. These laws are not necessarily more restrictive than the laws that will be implemented in the United States, but they do demonstrate that other developed countries have different approaches to abortion regulation.\n\nThirdly, the claim relies on a narrow definition of \"developed nations\" that only includes countries with a specific set of laws and policies. However, this definition is not universally accepted, and other countries may have different approaches to abortion regulation that are still considered \"developed\" in the broader sense.\n\nFinally, the claim ignores the fact that the Supreme Court decision",
    "pro_rebuttal": "I'd like to respectfully disagree with my opponent's argument. While it's true that the United States was not always in line with other developed nations on abortion rights, the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 did establish a national standard for abortion access, which was unique among developed countries at the time. Prior to that, many developed countries had laws restricting or prohibiting abortion, as my opponent acknowledged.\n\nRegarding the point that other developed countries have laws restricting abortion in various ways, I would argue that this is not equivalent to the United States' decision to allow states to set their own laws on abortion. While it's true that some countries have gestational limits or require parental consent, these laws are typically part of a national framework that ensures a certain level of consistency and access to abortion services. In contrast, the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has created a patchwork of laws across the United States, with some states allowing abortion up to birth and others banning it entirely.\n\nMy opponent's definition of \"developed nations\" is also problematic, as it implies that countries with different approaches to abortion regulation are not \"developed\" in the same way. However, the claim that the Supreme Court decision made the United States an outlier among developed nations is not about defining what it means to be a \"developed nation,\" but rather about the specific issue of abortion rights. The fact remains that the United States is now one of the few developed countries without a national standard for abortion access",

The President's statement is an opinion, not a fact. It is subjective and lacks concrete evidence to support the claim.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument that many developed countries have a national standard for access to abortion or consistency across subnational entities is not entirely accurate. While it is true that some countries have a national standard, others have varying laws and regulations at the regional or local level. For example, in Canada, abortion laws vary from province to province, and in the UK, abortion laws vary from country to country.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument that the US is one of the few developed countries where abortion is not widely available is also misleading. While it is true that some states have restricted access to abortion, others have not. In fact, many states have laws that protect a woman's right to choose, and some have even expanded access to reproductive healthcare services.\n\nFinally, the opponent's argument that the trend is towards expanding access to reproductive healthcare in other countries is not supported by evidence.

This lack of uniformity sets the U.S. apart from its peers, making it an outlier in the global community.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's statement that the Supreme Court's decision has made the United States an outlier among developed nations in the world is not only accurate but also a stark reality. The fact that many states are moving to narrow access to abortion, while other countries are expanding access, further reinforces this claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented has demonstrated that the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v.

I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that the cost of a Fourth of July cookout in 2022 increased by 67.2% due to inflation.\n\nFirstly, let's establish that inflation has indeed been a significant issue in recent years.

This is a clear indication that prices have been rising, and it's not just a one-time anomaly.\n\nFurthermore, food costs have increased at a higher rate of 10.4% during the same time period.

In fact, it's based on real data. According to the tweet, the cost of a classic July 4th meal has increased from $64.05 in 2022 to $106.45 in 2023.

As Dr. Michelle Forcier, a pediatrics professor, mentioned, \"Gender-affirming care for children might include allowing a child to wear whatever clothes they like or encouraging the use of the name and pronouns that align with the child's gender identity.\" This approach is not only unproven but also raises concerns about the potential long-term effects on the child's mental and physical health.\n\nMoreover, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that gender-affirming care for children should only include social support, such as allowing the child to use the name and pronouns that align with their gender identity.

The claim is based on speculation and misinformation spread through social media. The evidence presented shows that many of the athletes listed in the video were not vaccinated against COVID-19, and some had a history of heart problems or a family history of death by heart attack.\n\nSecondly, the claim relies on cherry-picked and manipulated information. The video uses ominous music and selective editing to create a false narrative, implying a link between the COVID-19 vaccine and the athletes' deaths. This is a classic example of confirmation bias and misinformation.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the overwhelming scientific evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. The vaccines have been extensively tested and have been proven to reduce the risk of serious illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. In fact, the vaccines have been shown to be more effective in preventing severe illness and death than any other intervention.\n\nFourthly, the claim is based on anecdotal evidence and ignores the vast amount of scientific research and data that supports the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.

I'm honored to present my opening argument in support of the claim that Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit or the national debt.\n\nFirstly, let's clarify the definition of the national debt. As stated by the article, the national debt is the accumulation of all past deficits, minus any surpluses. This means that the debt is a historical accumulation of past financial decisions, not a current issue.\n\nNow, let's examine the relationship between Social Security and the deficit. According to the article, Social Security adds to the unified deficit, but this does not mean it contributes to the national debt. The unified deficit refers to the total amount of money the government spends minus the total amount of revenue it receives, whereas the national debt is the accumulation of past deficits.\n\nFurthermore, it's essential to note that Social Security's finances are separate from the federal budget. The article states that when Social Security draws down its assets to pay benefits to baby boomer retirees, it contributes to the unified budget deficit. However, this does not mean that Social Security is responsible for the national debt.\n\nIn fact, multiple politicians, including President Trump and Vice President Pence, have explicitly stated that they will not cut Social Security benefits. Trump's campaign website even states that he will not cut Social Security, and Pence has repeatedly said that he will not reduce Social Security. This demonstrates that Social Security is not a target for deficit reduction.\n\nAdditionally, the article highlights that the deficit is",

As a representative of Progressive advocacy groups and labor unions, I'm here to provide evidence that contradicts this claim.\n\nFirstly, the claim that Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit or national debt is simply not accurate. The evidence shows that Social Security adds to the unified budget deficit. In fact, when Social Security draws down its assets to pay benefits to baby boomer retirees, it contributes to the unified budget deficit. This is a well-established fact, and it's not a \"fiction\" as the claim suggests.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit or national debt ignores the fact that the national debt is the accumulation of all past deficits, minus any surpluses. As the evidence states, \"The national debt is the accumulation of all past deficits, minus any surpluses.\" This means that Social Security's contributions to the deficit will ultimately impact the national debt.\n\nMoreover, the claim that Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit or national debt is also contradicted by the statements of politicians who have explicitly stated that they will not cut Social Security. For example, Joe Biden has said, \"I will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid.\" Similarly, Donald Trump has said, \"I will not cut Social Security, we're not going to cut future Social Security",

While it's true that Social Security adds to the unified budget deficit, this does not necessarily mean that it contributes to the national debt. The national debt is the accumulation of all past deficits, minus any surpluses, as my opponent correctly stated. However, the deficit and the debt are not the same thing.\n\nThe deficit refers to the annual shortfall between government spending and revenue, whereas the debt refers to the total amount of borrowing that has occurred over time. Just because Social Security adds to the deficit does not mean that it directly contributes to the national debt. In fact, the debt is the accumulation of all past deficits, including those that occurred before Social Security was even created.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument relies heavily on the assumption that Social Security's contributions to the deficit will ultimately impact the national debt. However, this is not necessarily the case. As the evidence states, \"over time, Social Security cannot add to the federal deficit.\" This means that Social Security's contributions to the deficit are temporary and will eventually be offset by other factors.\n\nAdditionally, my opponent's argument ignores the fact that Social Security's finances are separate from the rest of the federal budget. Social Security is a self-funded program that is supported by payroll taxes and interest on its trust funds. While it's true that Social Security's trust funds are invested in government securities, this does not mean that Social Security is directly contributing to the national debt.\n\nIn conclusion,",

While it is true that Social Security has its own trust funds, these funds are still part of the federal budget and are subject to the same fiscal constraints as the rest of the government. When Social Security draws down its assets to pay benefits, it does contribute to the unified budget deficit, which in turn affects the national debt.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's reliance on politicians' statements about not cutting Social Security benefits is unconvincing. Politicians often make campaign promises they may not intend to keep, and their statements should not be taken at face value. Moreover, even if politicians do not cut Social Security benefits, the program's long-term financial sustainability is still a concern. Social Security's trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2035, and the program's long-term solvency is dependent on a combination of revenue increases, benefit reductions, and/or changes to the program's structure.\n\nFinally, my opponent's argument ignores the broader context of the national debt and the federal budget.

The authors of the article correctly state that over time, Social Security cannot add to the federal deficit.\n\nThirdly, multiple politicians, including Harris and Trump, have explicitly stated that they will not cut Social Security benefits, and some have even gone as far as to say that they will not touch Social Security at all.\n\nFourthly, the deficit and debt are not the same thing.

It is possible to cut the annual deficit without reducing the federal debt, which is exactly what Social Security's finances do.\n\nFinally, the claim that Social Security's finances are linked to the deficit is a myth that has been repeatedly debunked.

Social Security and Medicare were explicitly mentioned as being \"obviously not intended\" to be included in the sunsetting provision, which means that they are, in fact, included.\n\nThirdly, the claim that Social Security adds to the unified deficit is supported by multiple sources, including the Congressional Budget Office and the Social Security Administration.

As the evidence suggests, this claim is not only supported by the Governor of Virginia but also backed by the data.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the numbers. According to the evidence, Virginia's revenue from income, sales, and corporate taxes has increased by 46.1% over the last four years. This is a significant growth rate, and it's not just a one-time fluke. The data shows that this growth is consistent across different tax categories, with gross non-withholding tax receipts rising by 94.3% and sales tax receipts increasing by 31.4%.\n\nNow, some might argue that this growth is due to external factors such as inflation or the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the evidence suggests that Virginia's economy has been growing steadily, with its GDP increasing by 30.1% over the same period. This is a strong indication that the state's economic fundamentals are sound, and the tax growth is not just a result of external factors.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence shows that Virginia's tax growth is not unique. Many states have experienced similar growth in their tax revenues, with some even exceeding Virginia's rate of growth.

However, this ignores the fact that other sources of revenue, such as gross non-withholding taxes, have also increased significantly. In fact, gross non-withholding tax receipts rose from $3.5 billion to $6.8 billion, a 94.3% increase, which is a much more significant contributor to the overall growth in tax receipts.\n\nSecondly, the claim does not account for inflation. When measured in 2012 dollars, Virginia's GDP rose from $445 billion to $494 billion, a growth rate of about 1.3%. This means that the actual growth in tax receipts is much lower than the 50% claimed.\n\nThirdly, the claim is based on a snapshot of tax receipts at a specific point in time, without considering the broader economic context.

In fact, researchers found that people who had a natural immunity from a previous COVID-19 infection were better protected against the virus during the delta-fueled surge than vaccinated people who had never been infected.\n\nSecondly, the data shows that unvaccinated people are at a lower risk of contracting COVID-19 and dying from it. According to the study, unvaccinated people are at a greater risk than vaccinated people of contracting COVID-19 and dying from it. This is because the vaccine does not provide 100% protection against the virus, and vaccinated people can still contract COVID-19.\n\nThirdly, the vaccine does not provide lifelong immunity, and people who are vaccinated may still be at risk of contracting COVID-19 in the future. In fact, the vaccine's effectiveness wanes over time, and booster shots are needed to maintain protection. This means that people who are vaccinated may still be at risk of contracting COVID-19 in the",

The evidence presented does not support the notion that unvaccinated individuals are better off than those who are vaccinated. In fact, the data consistently shows that unvaccinated individuals are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and dying from it.\n\nFirstly, the claim relies on a flawed interpretation of a study that found that people who had a natural immunity from a previous COVID-19 infection were better protected against the virus during the delta-fueled surge than vaccinated people who had never been infected. However, this study does not suggest that unvaccinated individuals are better off overall. In fact, it highlights the importance of vaccination in providing protection against COVID-19, especially for those who have not had a previous infection.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that vaccination provides a higher level of protection against COVID-19 than natural immunity. While natural immunity may provide some protection, it is not a guarantee against infection or severe illness. In contrast, vaccination has been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization due to COVID-19.\n\nThirdly, the claim is based on a flawed understanding of the concept of \"shedding\" and the risk of transmission from vaccinated individuals to unvaccinated individuals.

However, the claim being made is not just about the risk of infection, but also about the overall outcome of the pandemic. In this sense, the claim is not necessarily false, as it is possible that unvaccinated individuals may have fared better overall due to factors such as their behavior, lifestyle, and access to healthcare.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument ignores the fact that vaccination is not a guarantee against infection or severe illness. While vaccination has been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization due to COVID-19, it is not a foolproof method.

This is a significant amount of documents, equivalent to a tractor trailer worth, as claimed.\n\nNow, let's look at the evidence.

As a public health advocate, I am here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that New York City Mayor Eric Adams proposes to ban chocolate milk.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to acknowledge that Mayor Adams has indeed expressed concerns about the potential elimination of flavored milk in New York City schools. In 2019, as Brooklyn borough president, he urged the Education Department to adopt a pilot program to bring nondairy milk to schools. This move suggests that he is open to exploring alternative options for school milk.\n\nSecondly, it is crucial to note that chocolate milk is a significant contributor to the sugar intake of children.

By banning chocolate milk, Mayor Adams is taking a step towards promoting healthier beverage options for New York City's children.\n\nThirdly, the science behind the use of chocolate milk is indeed problematic.

The evidence suggests that this claim is FALSE. According to the article, Mayor Adams has stated that he wants alternatives before making any decisions, and that there is a science behind the use of chocolate milk. He also emphasized that making it sweet encourages children to drink more of it, but adds sugar, which causes health issues.

This is not the same as proposing a ban.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument relies heavily on the quote from Mayor Adams about the science behind chocolate milk, but this quote is taken out of context. The full quote, as provided in the article, suggests that Mayor Adams is concerned about the added sugar in chocolate milk, not the milk itself. This is a nuanced point that is often lost in the debate.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's emphasis on the economic impact of a ban is misplaced. While it's true that the dairy industry is important to New York's economy, the proposal is not to ban all dairy products, but rather to explore alternatives to chocolate milk.

This is a significant departure from previous administrations, which have historically been dominated by white, cisgender, and straight individuals.\n\nSecondly, the administration's policies have disproportionately benefited certain groups that have historically been marginalized or excluded from power. For example, the American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law by President Biden, provided significant relief to low-income families, communities of color, and small businesses, which were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a stark contrast to previous administrations, which have often prioritized the interests of wealthy corporations and individuals.\n\nThirdly, the administration's economic policies have led to record-breaking job growth, with the unemployment rate dropping to historic lows. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for Black Americans has fallen to its lowest level on record, and the unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans has reached its lowest level since 2000.

These claims are baseless and lack credible evidence.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented in this debate overwhelmingly supports the claim that we are facing a series of ecological disasters that are having a profound impact on our planet and our lives.

According to the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners, about 20 counties in the state elect their commissioners similarly to Wake, but these counties are not necessarily smaller in population.

The majority of western North Carolina counties, as well as many other counties across the state, have district-based elections, where voters elect commissioners who must reside in specific districts.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence highlights that Wake County's at-large election method can lead to commissioners being elected by voters from more populated areas, which may have different political goals and priorities than rural districts.

I'm honored to represent the Feminist organizations and advocacy groups, and I'm here to present our opening argument in support of the claim that Sen.

Tuberville has been blocking the routine promotion of 160 general and flag officers, a highly unusual move that has sparked controversy in the Senate. According to multiple sources, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Tuberville's actions are specifically aimed at protesting a new Pentagon policy that allows service members to access reproductive care, including abortion.\n\nNow, let's examine the evidence. In a March 28, 2023, Senate floor speech, Tuberville explicitly stated his opposition to the policy, citing concerns about taxpayer-funded travel and time off for elective abortions. This is a clear indication that his objections are centered around women's reproductive rights, rather than any other issue.\n\nFurthermore, Tuberville's office has consistently maintained that his actions are not intended to prevent pregnant women from accessing reproductive care, but rather to challenge the Pentagon's policy on elective abortions. However, this claim is undermined by the fact that Schumer's description of Tuberville's actions is more expansive, highlighting the senator's broader objections to women's access to reproductive care.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly suggests that Sen.

While it is true that Sen.

This is a crucial distinction that the claim conveniently glosses over.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that Sen. Tuberville's concerns are not limited to reproductive care, but also extend to broader issues such as the military's policy on transgender individuals serving in the military. For example, Sen. Tuberville has spoken out against the Pentagon's policy allowing transgender individuals to serve in the military, and has proposed amendments to restrict the military's ability to provide medical treatment for gender dysphoria.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Sen.

The study only measures the knowledge of 8th-grade students, which is a limited sample size. Moreover, the NAEP study doesn't provide a comprehensive picture of the entire education system. It's possible that students in other grade levels or schools may have a better understanding of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nSecondly, the Pew Research Center survey cited by my opponent is also problematic. The survey only asked about the perception of Americans, not about the actual curriculum or teaching practices in public schools. Perception is not always a reliable indicator of reality. It's possible that some Americans may be misinformed or have outdated information about what's being taught in public schools.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's reliance on expert opinions, such as Dr. Nieves, is also questionable.

This trend accelerated in the 1950s with the advent of antipsychotic medications, which significantly reduced symptoms for individuals with conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nAccording to the data, from 1955 to the 2010s, the resident population of state and county psychiatric institutions decreased by a staggering 93%, from over half a million to approximately 37,000. This decline was not solely the result of liberal policies, but rather a multifaceted effort to reform the mental health care system.\n\nExperts like Dr. Howard H. Goldman, a University of Maryland School of Medicine professor of psychiatry, confirm that state-based fiscal conservatives were also concerned about the costs of involuntary commitment and the reduction of personal freedom involved in institutionalization.

My opponent may claim that the bill does, but I'm here to present the facts that prove otherwise.\n\nFirstly, let's set the record straight. The House-passed debt-ceiling measure does not specifically cut veterans' programs. In fact, the bill does not mention veterans' programs at all. It's a general spending bill that aims to reduce discretionary spending across the board.\n\nSecondly, the bill's proponents, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have repeatedly assured us that they will not cut veterans' programs. McCarthy has stated, \"We make sure that our veterans and our service members are taken care of.\" This is a clear commitment to protecting veterans' benefits.\n\nThirdly, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that the bill would result in a 22% cut to discretionary spending, but this does not necessarily mean that veterans' programs will be affected. The CBO's estimates are based on general spending categories, and veterans' programs are not specifically mentioned.\n\nFourthly, the Veterans Administration (VA) has also stated that it assumes a full 22% cut to discretionary spending, but this is not the same as saying that veterans' programs will be cut. The VA is simply projecting a general reduction in spending, not a specific cut to veterans' programs.\n\nLastly,",

The evidence suggests that the House GOP debt-ceiling bill does indeed contain significant cuts to veterans' programs. Specifically, the bill rescinds any unspent funds, which could result in a 22% cut to veterans' programs in fiscal year 2024 compared to 2023 funding, and estimated reductions as high as $29.7 billion.\n\nMoreover, the bill does not exempt support for veterans' programs, and the VA has assumed a full cut for fiscal year 2024. This is not a minor or insignificant cut, but rather a substantial reduction that could have a significant impact on the lives of veterans.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that the bill is not cutting veterans is also misleading because it ignores the fact that the bill is a general spending category, and the estimates reflect uniform cuts to discretionary spending. This means that veterans' programs are not exempt from the cuts, and the VA has assumed a full cut for fiscal year 2024.\n\nAdditionally, the claim is also misleading because it ignores the fact that the bill does not require lawmakers to exempt spending for defense, veterans, and homeland security. This means that lawmakers would need to find other reductions to achieve their goals, which could result in even deeper cuts to other programs.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that \"I'm dead serious that we're not cutting veterans, and",

However, this argument is based on a flawed understanding of the bill and its implications.\n\nFirstly, the bill's rescission of unspent funds is not a cut to veterans' programs per se. Rather, it is a responsible fiscal move to eliminate wasteful spending and ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently. The VA has already identified areas where funds can be cut without affecting the quality of care for veterans, and the bill simply requires the agency to implement these efficiencies.\n\nSecondly, the 22% cut to veterans' programs in fiscal year 2024 is not a hard and fast rule. The bill does not specify that this cut must be implemented, and the VA has the discretion to adjust its budget accordingly. In fact, the VA has already indicated that it will work with Congress to ensure that veterans' programs are protected and that any cuts are implemented in a way that minimizes their impact.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's argument ignores the fact that the bill is a general spending category, and the estimates reflect uniform cuts to discretionary spending.

Additionally, the bill's 22% cut to discretionary spending could lead to reduced funding for veterans' programs, even if it's not a direct cut. The VA's assumption of a 22% cut is not just a projection, but a realistic estimate based on the bill's language.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's reliance on the CBO's estimates is misplaced. The CBO's estimates are based on general spending categories, but the bill's language is vague and doesn't provide specific exemptions for veterans' programs. This lack of specificity leaves room for interpretation and potential cuts to veterans' programs.\n\nLastly, while House Speaker McCarthy's statement is reassuring, it's not a binding commitment to protect veterans' programs. The bill's language and the VA's estimates suggest that veterans' programs could still be affected by the 22% cut.\n\nIn conclusion, while my opponent's argument is well-intentioned, it's based on incomplete information and ignores the potential consequences of the bill's language.

The evidence presented clearly demonstrates that the state has allocated $150 million to fund an additional 20,000 full-day slots, bringing the total number of funded slots to 157,000. This is a significant increase from the 137,000 slots funded in the previous year.\n\nMoreover, the state's budget director has confirmed that the funding is available for districts to serve preschoolers, although not every district has chosen to do so. This is not a claim that every eligible child will attend public preschool, but rather that the funding is available for those who need it.\n\nIt's important to note that the number of necessary slots is not equal to the number of 4-year-olds. The state uses a formula to determine the number of necessary slots, which is 85% of the kindergarten enrollment in public, charter, and private schools. This formula is set in education law and is used to ensure that the state is providing adequate funding for preschool programs.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented clearly shows that the New York state budget covers 96% of eligible preschoolers. The additional funding allocated in the 2023-24 budget will help to further increase the number of funded slots, bringing us closer to achieving universal pre-K.

The evidence suggests that the budget provides funding for 157,000 slots for 4-year-olds, which is roughly 96% of the estimated 163,000 slots needed. However, this number does not account for the fact that not all districts offer pre-K programs, and some districts have limited seats available.\n\nFurthermore, the claim does not take into account the eligibility criteria for pre-K programs, which may exclude certain children who are not eligible due to factors such as income or residency. Additionally, the claim does not provide information on the quality of the pre-K programs being funded, which is an important consideration for ensuring that children receive a high-quality education.\n\nIn conclusion, while the budget does provide funding for a significant number of pre-K slots, the claim that it covers 96% of eligible preschoolers is an oversimplification that does not accurately reflect the complexity of the issue.

Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, stated that Obama supported Iran's right to possess nuclear technology, including weapons. This claim is not entirely unfounded. In a speech, Obama did use the word \"right\" when discussing Iran's access to nuclear technology. He said, \"Any nation \u2014 including Iran \u2014 should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\"\n\nNow, some may argue that Obama was only referring to peaceful nuclear power, not weapons. However, this is a narrow interpretation. The fact remains that Obama did use the word \"right\" when discussing Iran's access to nuclear technology, which could be interpreted as including weapons.\n\nFurthermore, Obama's administration did sign the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, which lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for limiting its nuclear capabilities. This deal was widely criticized by Republicans, including Senator Cruz, who argued that it would make the US less safe by giving Iran access to nuclear technology.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Obama's administration did not explicitly rule out the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons in the future. In fact, Obama himself said, \"I understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not. No single nation should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons.",

He also emphasized the importance of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, citing its destabilizing behavior and support for terrorism.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence shows that Obama's administration was committed to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and the Iran nuclear agreement, signed in 2015, significantly restricted Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. This agreement was aimed at making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb and prohibited it from pursuing nuclear weapons in the future.\n\nIt's also important to note that Obama's statements were not about granting Iran a right to nuclear weapons, but rather about recognizing its right to access peaceful nuclear power. This is a crucial distinction, as the two are not equivalent.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Obama said Iran has a \"right\" to nuclear technology, including weapons, is FALSE and misleading.

However, Obama's statement that \"any nation, including Iran, should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\" is not a standalone statement, but rather part of a larger discussion about the importance of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\nIn fact, Obama's speech explicitly mentions the need to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, citing its destabilizing behavior and support for terrorism. This suggests that Obama's statement about Iran's right to access peaceful nuclear power is not a blanket endorsement of Iran's nuclear ambitions, but rather a conditional statement that is tied to Iran's compliance with its responsibilities under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument relies on a false dichotomy between \"peaceful nuclear power\" and \"nuclear weapons.\" However, the distinction between the two is not always clear-cut, and it is possible for a country to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes while still pursuing nuclear weapons.

Obama said, \"We were clear-eyed that Iran engages in destabilizing behavior \u2014 including support for terrorism, and threats toward Israel and its neighbors.

This deal was designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, not to give it a \"right\" to possess them.

According to Arloc Sherman, vice president for data analysis and research at the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, the early 1990s welfare-to-work requirements helped push employment rates higher. This is a crucial point, as it demonstrates that work requirements can indeed lead to increased employment.\n\nFurthermore, research by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, found that workers consistently earn more than the U.S. average at all education attainment levels. This suggests that work requirements can lead to higher earning potential for individuals.\n\nIt's also important to note that some studies have shown that work requirements can lead to increased employment rates, even in the context of food stamps and Medicaid.

This suggests that the relationship between work requirements and employment is more complex and nuanced than the claim suggests.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence highlights that many work requirements are not designed to provide meaningful support to individuals, but rather to create a paper trail of employment.

This can lead to individuals losing access to vital supports, even if they are working or should be exempt.\n\nAdditionally, the claim ignores the broader context of the economy and the labor market.

For instance, the study by the American Enterprise Institute found that research on programs that implemented work requirements in cash welfare recipients in the 1990s showed employment gains consistently. Similarly, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities found that the early 1990s welfare-to-work requirements helped push employment rates higher.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that work requirements are not designed to provide meaningful support to individuals is a misconception. Work requirements are designed to incentivize individuals to work and become self-sufficient, which is a fundamental principle of the social safety net. By requiring individuals to work in exchange for benefits, work requirements promote personal responsibility and accountability, which are essential for long-term economic growth and stability.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's argument that work requirements can lead to individuals losing access to vital supports is a red herring.

I'm honored to present my opening argument in support of the claim that Donald Trump \"never changed one immigration law.\" As we dive into the evidence, it's essential to acknowledge that Trump's presidency was marked by numerous executive orders and policy announcements, but ultimately, he failed to pass any significant immigration legislation.\n\nOne of the most significant points to note is that Trump never signed a major immigration law during his presidency. This is a fact that even his critics, such as Senator Lindsey Graham, have acknowledged. Graham stated, \"It is his fault because he never changed one immigration law in the two years that he had Republican control of Congress.\" This statement highlights the reality that despite having a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump was unable to pass any significant immigration legislation.\n\nAnother crucial point is that Trump's executive orders, while attention-grabbing, did not have a lasting impact on immigration policy. For instance, his birthright citizenship executive order was met with widespread criticism and was ultimately deemed unconstitutional by many experts. Additionally, his administration never issued a replacement plan for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was a major issue during his presidency.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's promises to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and make Mexico pay for it were never fulfilled.

While it is true that Trump did not sign any major immigration law during his presidency, he did issue several executive orders and took various actions that significantly impacted the country's immigration policies.\n\nFirstly, Trump's executive orders on immigration enforcement, such as the \"Executive Order on Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States\" (2017) and the \"Executive Order on Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements\" (2017), led to significant changes in the way immigration enforcement was carried out. These orders, for instance, expanded the definition of \"criminal aliens\" and allowed for the detention and deportation of individuals who had been previously released from custody.\n\nSecondly, Trump's administration implemented policies that restricted legal immigration, such as the \"Travel Ban\" (2017) and the \"Public Charge Rule\" (2019), which aimed to limit the entry of certain immigrants into the country. These policies were not laws, but they had a significant impact on the lives of millions of people.\n\nThirdly, Trump's administration also took steps to restrict access to asylum and other forms of legal immigration. For example, the \"Migrant Protection Protocols\" (2019) required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims were processed, and the \"Asylum Cooperative Agreements\" (2019) allowed the U.S. to",

Trump did not sign any major immigration law during his presidency, and his executive orders and administrative actions did not change any existing immigration laws. The executive orders and policies implemented by Trump were merely executive branch actions that did not require Congressional approval or legislative changes to existing laws.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's examples of Trump's executive orders and policies are misleading. The \"Executive Order on Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States\" and the \"Executive Order on Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements\" did not change any immigration laws. They simply directed the Department of Homeland Security to implement certain policies and procedures to enforce existing immigration laws more effectively.\n\nSimilarly, the \"Travel Ban\" and the \"Public Charge Rule\" were not laws, but rather executive branch actions that were challenged in court and ultimately stayed or blocked.

These policies were widely criticized and had a significant impact on the lives of many individuals and families.\n\nSecondly, Trump's administration did issue a replacement plan for the DACA program, which was a major issue during his presidency. While the plan was not as comprehensive as some had hoped, it did provide a pathway to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children.\n\nThirdly, Trump's administration did make progress on the border wall, albeit not as much as he had promised. The administration did allocate funds for the construction of the wall, and while it was not as extensive as Trump had envisioned, it did lead to the construction of new barriers along the US-Mexico border.\n\nFinally, Trump's administration did take steps to end birthright citizenship, which is a significant change to US immigration policy.

Trump's executive orders, such as the one on birthright citizenship, were met with criticism and controversy, and did not have the same legal standing as a passed law.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented in this debate clearly shows that Donald Trump did not change one immigration law during his presidency.

He said, \"Throughout history, religions dreamt about having a book written by a superhuman intelligence, by a non-human entity. Every religion claims our book \u2014 'Oh, the books of the other religions, they \u2014 humans wrote them, but our book? No, no, no, no, it came from some superhuman intelligence.'

Harari's actual statement was about the potential for AI to create new forms of religious texts, not about the World Economic Forum specifically calling for AI to rewrite the Bible.\n\nFurthermore, the World Economic Forum has repeatedly denied making any such claims.

I'm thrilled to be here today to discuss the claim that \"Per capita, more Floridians move to California than Californians moving to Florida.\" As a young urban voter, I firmly believe that this claim is TRUE, and I'm excited to present my argument.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the evidence. According to the U.S. Census Bureau data, more Floridians have moved to California than Californians moving to Florida. This is a fact that has been consistently observed over the past two decades. Stefan Rayer, the director of the University of Florida's Population Program, has stated that this trend is part of a nearly two-decade trend.\n\nNow, some might argue that the raw numbers show that close to 13,000 more Californians moved to Florida than the other way around. However, this is where the per capita data comes in. When we adjust for population size, we see that more Floridians move to California per capita than Californians moving to Florida. In 2021, for example, 1.16 per 1,000 Floridians moved to California, while only 0.96 Californians moved to Florida.\n\nFurthermore, the data shows that this trend is not a one-time anomaly.

California has a population of approximately 17 million more residents than Florida.\n\nThe evidence provided by the University of Florida's Population Program in the Bureau of Economic and Business Research shows that in 2021, 1.16 per 1,000 Floridians moved to California, while 0.96 Californians moved to Florida. This means that while more Floridians moved to California, the rate of migration is actually higher for Californians moving to Florida.\n\nFurthermore, the article highlights that the migration patterns between Florida and California have a slim margin, with net migration being close to zero. This suggests that the number of people moving from one state to the other is relatively small compared to the overall population sizes.\n\nAdditionally, the article mentions that Florida tends to have a positive net migration balance with many states, which is due at least in part to retirement migration.

According to the data, under President Biden, there have been over 4.6 million encounters at our southern border, with around 8 million encounters since he took office.

The evidence shows that while there has been an increase in encounters under Biden, the number of removals and deportations has actually decreased. In fact, under Biden, around 3.9 million encounters had resulted in people being removed, returned or expelled from the U.S., which is a lower rate than the previous administrations.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that the resources available for deportations have remained largely the same under Biden, despite the increase in encounters.

I am here to present the case for the claim that two pipeline workers in the Chicago area were given fentanyl-laced water bottles. As a representative of labor unions and worker advocacy groups, I am deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of workers in the construction industry.\n\nThe evidence presented suggests that two employees of NPL Pipeline Co. were offered water bottles by a passenger in a passing vehicle, which were later found to be laced with fentanyl. This is not an isolated incident, as similar reports have surfaced in San Diego and Washington state, where construction workers were also given fentanyl-laced water bottles.\n\nThe fact that fentanyl is being used to lace water bottles is a serious concern, as it is a highly potent and dangerous drug that can be deadly in small quantities. According to the CDC, fentanyl is 50-100 times more potent than morphine and can be fatal in as little as 2-3 minutes.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that fentanyl is being used by drug traffickers to produce the drug, and that it is often cut with other substances to increase its potency. This makes it difficult to detect and can lead to accidental overdoses.\n\nThe fact that two workers were given fentanyl-laced water bottles and one of them died, while the other was critically injured, is a stark reminder of the dangers that workers face on a daily basis.

As we conclude this debate, I would like to reiterate that the claim \"The No. 1 weather-related killer is heat. 600 people die annually from its effects, more than from floods, hurricanes and tornadoes in America combined\" is indeed TRUE.\n\nThroughout this debate, we have presented a plethora of evidence from credible sources, including the National Weather Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and various scientific studies. These sources have consistently shown that heat-related deaths far surpass those caused by floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes in the United States.\n\nWhile some may argue that the numbers are not exact, and that heat deaths may not always be officially recorded as such, the overwhelming consensus among scientists is that heat is a significant and preventable killer. In fact, experts estimate that heat-related deaths are often underreported, and that the actual number of deaths could be much higher.\n\nMoreover, the evidence presented has demonstrated that heat waves have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, young children, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. This highlights the importance of taking proactive measures to mitigate the effects of heat, such as improving heat wave forecasting, increasing public awareness, and implementing heat-related emergency preparedness plans.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer in the United States is supported by a wealth of scientific evidence.

I'm here to present the argument that \"We've eliminated critical race theory in our K through 12 schools.\" As a conservative think tank, we believe that this claim is indeed TRUE.\n\nFirstly, let's define what critical race theory is. It's a concept that race is a social construct, and that racism is not just an individual's prejudice, but something that's embedded within legal systems and policies. While some may argue that this theory is necessary to understand systemic racism, we believe that it's a divisive and harmful ideology that promotes racial resentment and division.\n\nNow, let's look at the evidence. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law that prohibits the teaching of critical race theory in public schools. This law was passed in response to concerns that the theory was being taught in some schools, and that it was promoting a harmful and divisive narrative.\n\nFurthermore, educators and school officials have confirmed that critical race theory was not being taught in Florida's elementary, middle, or high schools. In fact, a spokesperson for the Sarasota County Schools said that \"Our traditional public schools have not taught, were not teaching, and do not teach critical race theory \u2014 it is not a part of the K-12 state standards.\"\n\nIn addition, several states have banned critical race theory in public schools, including Iowa, where a law was passed to stop the use of race as a factor for admissions.

This statement is clear and unequivocal, and it refutes the claim that critical race theory is being taught in K-12 schools.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that educators and school officials have consistently denied that critical race theory is being taught in their schools. For example, the Virginia Department of Education webpage lists books that are not related to critical race theory, and the author of the slide presentation, Lane, has stated that her focus was on helping teachers be proactive in finding solutions to the problem of out-of-school suspension rates that primarily affected Black students, not on how to implement teaching critical race theory.\n\nThirdly, the evidence highlights the lack of evidence to support the claim that critical race theory is being taught in K-12 schools.

Many educators and school officials have acknowledged that critical race theory is being used as a framework to understand systemic racism and its impact on students' lives. For example, the author of the slide presentation, Lane, has stated that her focus was on helping teachers be proactive in finding solutions to the problem of out-of-school suspension rates that primarily affected Black students, which is a critical issue that is closely related to critical race theory.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights the lack of transparency and accountability in the education system. While educators and school officials may not be teaching critical race theory explicitly, they may be incorporating its principles and concepts into their instruction without explicitly labeling it as such. This lack of transparency and accountability makes it difficult to determine whether critical race theory is being taught or not.\n\nThirdly, the evidence shows that there is a growing movement among educators to incorporate critical race theory into instruction, particularly in U.S. history.

It is a complex and multifaceted idea that encompasses a range of perspectives and approaches to understanding systemic racism and its impact on society. As such, it is unlikely that a simple ban on the theory would be effective in eliminating it.\n\nSecondly, even if critical race theory were to be banned in public schools, it is likely that it would continue to be taught in other settings, such as universities and community organizations. This would mean that the theory would continue to be disseminated and discussed, even if it were not being taught in public schools.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that the ban on critical race theory in public schools is not necessarily a neutral or objective measure. It is a political decision that reflects the values and beliefs of those who are making it, and it may have unintended consequences that are not necessarily beneficial to society.\n\nIn conclusion, while my opponent's claim that \"We've eliminated critical race theory in our K through 12 schools\" may be technically true in the sense that some states have banned the teaching of the theory in public schools, it is not a accurate reflection of the complexity and multif",

The state's education department has also confirmed that critical race theory is not part of the K-12 state standards. Furthermore, the bill signed by Governor DeSantis in 2022 prohibits subjects related to critical race theory in Florida's workplaces and schools, effectively eliminating its presence in the education system.\n\nWhile some may argue that critical race theory is a broader concept that can be applied to various aspects of society, the fact remains that it is not being taught in K-12 schools. The claim is not about the existence of critical race theory as a concept, but about its presence in K-12 education, and the evidence clearly shows that it has been eliminated.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim \"We've eliminated critical race theory in our K through 12 schools\" is supported by the evidence presented, and I urge the audience to accept this claim as TRUE.",

Critical race theory is a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses a range of ideas and perspectives, and it's not possible to simply \"eliminate\" it from education.\n\nMoreover, the evidence presented suggests that critical race theory was not being taught in Florida's elementary, middle, or high schools, and that the state's education standards do not include it. Additionally, educators and school officials have stated that they were not teaching critical race theory, and that it is not part of the K-12 state standards.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that critical race theory is a \"racist curriculum\" is a mischaracterization and a form of misinformation. Critical race theory is a framework for understanding systemic racism and its impact on society, and it is not inherently racist.\n\nIn conclusion, while some states may have banned critical race theory, the claim that it has been entirely eliminated from K-12 education is FALSE. Critical race theory is a complex and multifaceted concept that continues to be an important part of academic discourse and critical thinking. It is essential to approach this topic with nuance and accuracy, rather than relying on misinformation and mischaracterizations.",
    "final_verdict": "Based on the arguments and evidence presented, I find the claim \"We've eliminated critical race theory in our K through 12 schools\" to be HALF-TRUE.\n\nThe evidence suggests that critical race theory is not being taught in K-12 schools in the classical sense, and educators and school officials have consistently denied its presence in their curriculum. However, the claim is not entirely accurate because critical race theory is a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses a range of ideas and perspectives, and it is not possible to simply \"eliminate\" it from education. Additionally, the ban on critical race theory in public schools is a political decision that reflects the values and beliefs of those who are making it, and it may have unintended consequences that are not necessarily beneficial to society.\n\nTherefore, while the claim is partially true in the sense that critical race theory is not being taught in K-12 schools, it is also partially false because it oversimplifies the complexity of the issue and ignores the broader context in which critical race theory operates."

According to various experts, energy independence can be measured in three ways: (1) being a net exporter of energy, (2) having domestic production exceed domestic consumption, and (3) reducing reliance on foreign energy sources.\n\nNow, let's look at the evidence. According to the data, the United States has indeed become a net exporter of energy for the first time in 75 years. This is a significant achievement, and it's a testament to the country's progress in increasing its energy production and reducing its reliance on foreign energy sources.\n\nMoreover, the data shows that the United States has consistently increased its energy production over the past decade, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. This growth in energy production has been driven by advances in renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power, as well as improvements in energy efficiency.\n\nIn addition, the United States has made significant strides in reducing its reliance on foreign energy sources. According to the Energy Information Administration, the country's net petroleum imports have decreased by over 40% since 2010.

The Inflation Reduction Act introduced a Medicare drug price negotiation policy, which allows Medicare to negotiate the price of certain drugs. This policy has resulted in significant cost savings for Medicare recipients. According to the evidence, insulin costs for Medicare recipients are now capped at $35 a month, down from $400 a month. This is a staggering reduction of 91.25%.\n\nFurthermore, the negotiated drug prices will also result in lower costs for beneficiaries who take those drugs. The new $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket spending will lower costs for older Americans who pay the most. This is a crucial aspect of the policy, as it ensures that seniors are not burdened with excessive out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nThe evidence also suggests that the negotiated prices will be significantly lower than the average sales prices. The Maximum Fair Price, which is the upper limit on price, is expected to be lower than average sales prices. This will save Medicare and taxpayers money on those drugs.\n\nIt's essential to note that the claim is not exaggerated.

In fact, the evidence suggests that the actual cost savings may be much lower than 35 cents per month.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that the negotiated prices are not a fixed price, but rather a cap on the price of certain drugs.

This means that many seniors may not benefit from the negotiated prices, and may still pay higher prices for their medications.\n\nFinally, the evidence highlights that the negotiated prices are not a guarantee of low prices, and that the actual cost of the drugs may still be higher than expected.

The evidence suggests that the policy is still in its early stages, and it's too soon to make sweeping claims about the impact on seniors' drug costs.\n\nSecondly, the $35 cap on insulin costs is not as straightforward as the opponent suggests. The evidence from the American Enterprise Institute notes that the U.S. drug price negotiation system is limited and doesn't operate like the system in Europe, where prices are set for all prescriptions.

The evidence shows that Medicare recipients were previously paying much more than $35 per month for their medications, and the new policy has brought those costs down to a fraction of what they were before.\n\nFurthermore, the negotiation of drug prices is a crucial step towards making prescription drugs more affordable for all Americans, not just Medicare recipients. By using its buying power, Medicare can negotiate better prices for drugs, which will benefit not only seniors but also the broader population.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that seniors are paying no more than 35 cents for drugs is a fact, and it's a testament to the success of the Medicare drug negotiation policy.

In December 2020, the final full month before Biden took office, the employment level fell by 115,000, which was the only absolute loss of jobs since April 2020.\n\nHowever, under the Biden-Harris administration, unemployment for all groups has been low by historical standards. In fact, the unemployment rate dipped below 4% by the end of Biden's first year in office, which is a remarkable achievement. Moreover, the number of unemployed Americans has decreased significantly, with the number of people receiving unemployment benefits falling from 18 million to under 1.6 million, the lowest in decades.\n\nFurthermore, the growth in part-time work during Biden's tenure was driven by people working part-time by choice, not because they couldn't find full-time jobs.

In December 2020, the final full month before Biden's inauguration, the employment level fell by 115,000, which was the only absolute loss of jobs since April 2020.

As we can see from the evidence, the price of bacon has risen by 30% since Biden took office, which is a significant increase.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the data. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the price of eggs, a staple item in many American households, has risen from $1.60 per dozen in February 2021 to $4.10 in December 2024, a staggering 155% increase. This is a clear indication that food prices have risen under Biden's presidency.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that food prices have risen during Biden's presidency. In fact, the biggest increase during his first three years was for cereals and bakery goods, 25.6%. Nonalcoholic beverage prices also rose faster than food inflation overall, 21.4%. Meats, poultry, fish, and eggs collectively rose by 20.2%. These figures demonstrate that food prices have increased significantly under Biden's watch.\n\nThirdly, it's important to note that wage growth has not kept pace with food inflation. In fact, wages have risen by 17.7% during Biden's presidency, while prices have risen by 19.4%.

The evidence shows that the price of bacon has increased by 30% during Biden's presidency, not five times. This is a significant difference, and it's essential to be accurate when discussing economic data.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the broader context of food price inflation. The evidence shows that food prices have risen during Biden's presidency, but this is not unique to his administration. In fact, the five presidents before Biden saw overall food prices rise from 5.3% to 12.3% during their first three years in office. This suggests that food price inflation is a natural phenomenon that is not solely caused by Biden's policies.\n\nThirdly, the claim fails to consider the impact of supply-chain difficulties and the coronavirus pandemic on food prices.

I'm here to present the argument that Joe Biden indeed put 20 million people on Medicaid who aren't even eligible, then stopped states from taking them off.

As we conclude this debate, I would like to reiterate that it is indeed true that the United States has a long-standing policy of requiring Americans who intend to be evacuated from overseas to sign a promissory note.\n\nThroughout the debate, we have presented a wealth of evidence, dating back to at least 79 years, that demonstrates this policy has been consistently implemented by various administrations, including the George H.W. Bush administration, the Clinton administration, and even the Trump administration. We have seen examples of evacuations from countries such as Iraq, Kuwait, El Salvador, and Israel, where evacuees were asked to sign promissory notes to repay the costs of their evacuation.\n\nWe have also seen that this policy is not limited to emergency situations, but is a standard practice in the event of evacuations. The State Department's own guidance and regulations support this claim, stating that the department is authorized to use emergency funds to evacuate U.S. citizens from abroad, and that the transportation costs must be reimbursed through a loan.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence is clear: the United States has a long-standing policy of requiring Americans who intend to be evacuated from overseas to sign a promissory note. This policy has been consistently implemented across multiple administrations and has been supported by various government agencies and regulations.

The graph clearly indicates that gasoline prices have increased significantly during his tenure, with a notable spike in prices since the start of the war in Ukraine.\n\nNow, let's examine the evidence. According to the Federal Energy Information Administration, the average per-gallon gasoline price during President Trump's four-year term was $2.46. In contrast, the average price during President Biden's tenure so far has been $3.53. This represents an increase of $1.07 per gallon, or approximately 43.4%.\n\nFurthermore, we can see that the rise in gasoline prices began even before President Biden took office. In mid-May 2020, gas prices sat at around $1.88 a gallon. By late January 2021, when President Trump left office and Biden was sworn in, a gallon of gas had risen to about $2.39 a gallon, an increase of about 50 cents.\n\nIt's also important to note that the sharpest increases at the pump have come since the start of the war in Ukraine.

Furthermore, the claim that the tax increase was part of a broader effort to stimulate economic growth does not necessarily mean that it was not a tax increase.\n\nFinally, the claim that Justice \"tried to make us pay even more at the pump by hiking the gas tax\" is not entirely inaccurate.

Senate Bill 1006 did not raise the gas tax without a plan to reduce the state's reliance on it; instead, it increased the tax to fund highway infrastructure projects, which Justice argued would create jobs and improve infrastructure.\n\nSecondly, the pledge was not a binding contract, but rather a campaign promise. While it is important to hold leaders accountable for their promises, it is also important to recognize that campaign promises are not always binding. Justice's team did not accuse Evers of hypocrisy for pushing a gas tax increase because they acknowledged the pledge was broken; rather, they accused him of hypocrisy because he had previously criticized Justice for raising the gas tax.\n\nFinally, the evidence suggests that Justice did not break his pledge because he had not signed the bill yet. The bill was passed almost six years after Justice signed it, and it is impossible for him to have broken a pledge he had not yet signed.\n\nIn conclusion, while Justice did sign a bill that increased the gas tax, this does not necessarily mean he broke his",

This legislation aimed to fund highway projects and improve infrastructure, which Justice himself applauded.\n\nIt's crucial to note that Justice didn't break his pledge because he hadn't signed it yet.

I'm honored to present my opening argument in support of the claim that \"Only in Washington can you cut funding, add a pay-for to a new spending measure, and they say it's terrible for the deficit.\"\n\nAs we examine the evidence, it's clear that this claim is rooted in reality. In Washington, it's a common practice to cut funding, add a pay-for to a new spending measure, and then claim it's terrible for the deficit. This is evident in the way lawmakers operate, where they often propose cutting funding to certain programs, only to add a pay-for to a new spending measure, and then claim it's a deficit-busting move.\n\nFor instance, we see this in the way the House budget proposal has been criticized for cutting funding to public education, while also proposing a new spending measure that's not paid for. This is a classic example of cutting funding, adding a pay-for, and then claiming it's terrible for the deficit.\n\nFurthermore, we have evidence from experts like Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who notes that there can be long lags in some programs between funding and spending. This means that even if funding is cut, it may not immediately affect the deficit. However, this nuance is often lost in the political rhetoric, and lawmakers continue to claim that cutting funding is terrible for the deficit.\n\nAdditionally, we see this pattern play out in the",

This claim is an oversimplification of the complex budget process in Washington D.C. and ignores the nuances of how budgeting works.\n\nFirstly, the claim implies that cutting funding and adding a pay-for to a new spending measure is a unique phenomenon exclusive to Washington D.C. However, this is not accurate. Budgeting involves making difficult decisions about how to allocate resources, and it's common for governments to make trade-offs between different spending priorities. In fact, the evidence suggests that state governments, such as Wisconsin, also make similar decisions about funding and budgeting.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that budgeting is a complex process that involves multiple stakeholders and competing interests. The evidence shows that lawmakers often disagree on how to allocate funds, and that's why we see continuing resolutions and omnibus bills. These practices are not unique to Washington D.C. and are a result of the political process, not a deliberate attempt to manipulate the deficit.\n\nThirdly, the claim is misleading because it implies that cutting funding is always bad for the deficit.

For example, the Congressional Budget Office has shown that reducing spending can lead to a reduction in the deficit. Additionally, the evidence suggests that some spending",

However, I strongly disagree.\n\nFirstly, my opponent's argument that cutting funding and adding a pay-for to a new spending measure is not unique to Washington D.C. is a weak attempt to downplay the significance of the claim. While it is true that budgeting involves making difficult decisions about how to allocate resources, the claim is specifically about the unique phenomenon of cutting funding, adding a pay-for, and then claiming it's terrible for the deficit. This is a distinct pattern that is often seen in Washington D.C. and is not commonly seen in other governments.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that the claim ignores the complexity of the budget process is also flawed. While it is true that budgeting is a complex process, the claim is not about the complexity of the process, but rather about the specific actions taken by lawmakers in Washington D.C. The evidence shows that lawmakers in Washington D.C. often engage in this behavior, and it is a pattern that is unique to this city.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's argument that cutting spending can actually help reduce the deficit is a misleading interpretation of the evidence.

Lawmakers do not simply cut funding and add a pay-for to a new spending measure without considering the long-term implications on the deficit. In reality, the budget process involves a thorough analysis of the impact of proposed spending and revenue measures on the deficit, and lawmakers must make difficult decisions about how to allocate resources.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that lawmakers often propose budget cuts as part of a larger package of spending and revenue measures.

This is evident in the examples provided, such as the proposed House budget cutting hundreds of millions in funding from public education, and the Congressional Budget Office stating that the proposed spending is not paid for, resulting in $3 trillion of deficit spending.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence also shows that this practice is not limited to one party, as both Democrats and Republicans have been guilty of this tactic. For instance, the article mentions that lawmakers have resorted to continuing resolutions and omnibus bills for the better part of three decades, which is a common practice that has contributed to the federal debt.\n\nIn addition, the article highlights the fact that the Congressional Budget Office says it's not paid for, which means that the spending is not offset by revenue increases or spending cuts elsewhere in the budget.

As we dive into the evidence, I'd like to highlight the facts that support this claim.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the statement made by Newsom, which sets the tone for our discussion. Newsom claims that DeSantis supported amnesty, and we'll examine the evidence to determine the truth behind this claim.\n\nOne piece of evidence that stands out is DeSantis' co-sponsorship of the \"Goodlatte II bill in 2018.\" This bill aimed to provide a pathway to legal status for 2 million immigrants. DeSantis himself pointed to this bill as evidence that Trump supported giving amnesty to 2 million immigrants. This is a clear indication that DeSantis was open to the idea of providing legal status to certain individuals who were in the country illegally.\n\nAnother important piece of evidence is DeSantis' vote on the Fair Tax bill in 2015. Although the bill didn't specifically mention amnesty, it did outline a path for Puerto Rico's statehood. DeSantis co-sponsored this bill, which could be seen as a step towards providing legal status to Puerto Rican residents who are currently U.S. citizens but lack voting representation.\n\nFurthermore, DeSantis' stance on Boehner's immigration principles is also relevant.

This bill aimed to provide a pathway for Puerto Rico to become a state, not grant amnesty to illegal aliens.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that DeSantis voted against an amnesty bill in 2018, which is a clear indication that he did not support amnesty. DeSantis himself stated that he opposed an amnesty bill that would have granted legal status to 2 million illegal aliens.\n\nThirdly, the evidence shows that DeSantis has consistently voted in favor of border security measures, including building border barriers and funding for the wall. This is a clear indication that he is committed to securing the border and enforcing immigration laws, rather than granting amnesty to illegal aliens.\n\nLastly, the evidence points out that DeSantis' voting record is not consistent with the definition of amnesty that Newsom is using. Newsom's definition of amnesty is unclear, but it appears to be based on a broad interpretation of the term. However, DeSantis' voting record shows that he has consistently opposed measures that would grant legal status to illegal aliens, which is a key component of the definition of amnesty.",

While it is true that the bill aimed to provide a pathway for Puerto Rico to become a state, it also included provisions that would have granted legal status to certain individuals who were previously undocumented. This is a key component of the definition of amnesty, and DeSantis' co-sponsorship of the bill suggests that he was open to the idea of granting legal status to certain individuals.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that DeSantis voted against an amnesty bill in 2018 is true, but it is also incomplete. The bill that DeSantis voted against was a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included a range of provisions, including a pathway to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants. While DeSantis may have opposed the bill as a whole, it is unclear whether he would have opposed a standalone amnesty provision.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's argument that DeSantis has consistently voted in favor of border security measures is true, but it is also irrelevant to the claim that he supported amnesty.

Instead, it aimed to provide a pathway to legal status for certain immigrants who were already in the country illegally.\n\nMoreover, DeSantis' vote on the Fair Tax bill in 2015 was not directly related to amnesty. The bill outlined a path for Puerto Rico's statehood, which would have granted U.S. citizenship to Puerto Rican residents. This is a different issue from amnesty, which typically refers to the act of granting legal status to individuals who are currently in the country illegally.\n\nRegarding DeSantis' stance on Boehner's immigration principles, it's important to note that he initially said \"yes\" to supporting these principles, but later changed his stance to \"no.\" This suggests that DeSantis may have had reservations about certain aspects of the principles, rather than fully supporting amnesty.\n\nIn conclusion, while DeSantis did co-sponsor a bill that aimed to provide a pathway to legal status for certain immigrants, it's important to consider the nuances of the issue and not oversimplify it as \"amnesty.\" Additionally, DeSantis' other actions and statements suggest that he has not consistently supported amnesty.

Furthermore, DeSantis' own words, as quoted in a Q&A, confirm that he supported Boehner's immigration principles, which included a pathway to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants.

While DeSantis did co-sponsor a bill that could potentially provide a legal status to certain individuals, it's essential to note that this bill was not an amnesty bill in the classical sense. The bill, known as the Goodlatte II bill, aimed to provide a pathway to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as minors, known as DREAMers.\n\nMoreover, DeSantis' voting record in Congress shows that he has consistently opposed amnesty measures. He voted against an amnesty bill in 2018 and has repeatedly expressed opposition to granting amnesty to illegal aliens. In fact, he has stated that he believes in securing the border and enforcing immigration laws, rather than providing amnesty to those who have entered the country illegally.\n\nIt's also important to note that DeSantis has never supported a comprehensive amnesty bill that would grant legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants. His record on immigration has been focused on securing the border, enforcing immigration laws, and providing a pathway to citizenship for certain groups, such as DREAMers, through a more nuanced and targeted approach.\n\nIn conclusion, while DeSantis did co-sponsor a bill that could potentially provide a legal status to certain individuals, his overall record on immigration and his statements on the issue suggest that he does not support amnesty",

However, the evidence also suggests that DeSantis has consistently opposed amnesty measures and has focused on securing the border and enforcing immigration laws. Additionally, the definition of amnesty used by Newsom is unclear, and DeSantis' voting record does not consistently support the idea of granting legal status to illegal aliens. Therefore, the claim that DeSantis supported amnesty when he was in Congress is partially true, but also partially misleading."

This is not a straightforward tax increase, but rather a complex proposal that aimed to balance the budget and provide relief to homeowners.

I'm thrilled to present my opening argument in support of the claim that China is allowed to do crypto mining in the U.S.\n\nAs we begin, it's essential to understand the context of crypto mining. Crypto mining is the process of verifying transactions on a blockchain network, which requires significant computational power. This process is energy-intensive, and many countries, including the United States, have seen a surge in crypto mining operations.\n\nNow, let's examine the evidence. According to a recent article, Chinese crypto miners have moved their operations to the United States, with at least 12 states hosting Chinese-owned or operated crypto mines. These mines collectively use as much energy as more than 1 million homes. This is a significant presence, and it's crucial to acknowledge that these operations are not just small-scale endeavors.\n\nSome may argue that these operations are not directly controlled by the Chinese government, but the article highlights that many of these mines have connections to China's private sector. This raises concerns about the potential for Chinese government or Communist Party influence. Experts in China policy have indeed warned that U.S. crypto mining operations with ties to China's private sector could pose a risk of Chinese government influence.\n\nFurthermore, the article mentions that some of these mines operate in a gray regulatory area, which raises concerns about the lack of transparency and oversight.

While it is true that Haley has expressed concerns about the sustainability of Social Security and Medicare, her statements have been taken out of context and do not support the claim that she believes the retirement age should be significantly higher.\n\nFirstly, Haley's statements about the retirement age being \"way too low\" are not a call to raise the age to 70 or 80, but rather a recognition that the age needs to be adjusted to reflect longer life expectancy. This is a reasonable and logical approach, but it does not necessarily mean that the age should be increased to an extreme level.\n\nSecondly, Haley's proposal to raise the retirement age is not a blanket policy that applies to all individuals. She has specifically stated that she would only apply this change to younger individuals who are just entering the system, which means that current retirees and those nearing retirement would not be affected.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument that Haley's plan is not unprecedented is misleading. While it is true that the retirement age has been increased from 65 to 67 for people born after 1960, this change was made to ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security, not to reflect longer life expectancy.

Haley has also proposed increasing the retirement age for younger people, such as those in their 20s, to ensure the long-term sustainability of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIt's important to note that Haley's plan would not affect current beneficiaries or those nearing retirement, as she has explicitly stated that she would not touch anyone's retirement or anyone who's been promised. Instead, her plan would focus on adjusting the retirement age for younger generations to reflect changes in life expectancy.\n\nThe Trump ad's claim that Haley's plan would end or cut into older Americans' Social Security retirement is an extreme exaggeration and a misrepresentation of her actual proposal.

I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that the last time Democrats removed a Republican from the ballot was Abraham Lincoln in 1860.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to clarify that the claim is not about Democrats actively removing Lincoln from the ballot, but rather, it's about the circumstances surrounding his election. As stated in the evidence, Lincoln's name did not appear on the ballot in many Southern states because the Republican Party didn't have a strong presence or organization in those areas. This is a historical fact, supported by experts such as Louis Masur, a Rutgers University American studies and history professor, who stated that \"Democrats didn't remove Lincoln from ballots. He didn't appear because the Republican party 'in effect, did not exist in those states'.\"\n\nFurthermore, historians agree that political parties were responsible for printing and distributing their own ballots to supporters in the mid-19th century. Since the Republican Party didn't expect to receive many votes in slaveholding Southern states, they didn't waste resources printing and handing out ballots there. This is corroborated by Jonathan W.

White and Louis Masur point out, Abraham Lincoln was not removed from the ballot in 1860. Instead, he didn't appear on the ballot in many Southern states because the Republican Party didn't have a strong presence or organization in those states. This was due to the fact that the Republican Party was a new and relatively weak party at the time, and it didn't have the resources or infrastructure to distribute ballots in all states.\n\nSecondly, the claim implies that Democrats actively removed Lincoln from the ballot, which is not supported by the evidence. In fact, the evidence suggests that the Republican Party itself didn't distribute ballots in many Southern states, which meant that Lincoln's name was not included on the ballot in those states.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is misleading because it implies that Democrats have a history of removing Republicans from the ballot, which is not accurate.

This suggests that Democrats took deliberate action to exclude Lincoln from the ballot, which is a form of removal.

I'm honored to present my opening argument in support of the claim that nearly a quarter million birds in New York City, and more than one billion across the country, die each year from collisions with buildings.\n\nAs a representative of a wildlife conservation organization, I'd like to emphasize the gravity of this issue. According to Dustin Partridge, the group's director of conservation and science, between 90,000 and 243,000 birds die from collisions every year in New York City alone. This staggering number is supported by data collected by NYC Audubon, an environmental group dedicated to protecting birds and their habitats.\n\nFurthermore, nationally, 621 million to 2 billion birds die annually in the U.S. from collisions, with potentially billions more dying similarly worldwide. This is a staggering loss of life, and it's essential we acknowledge the impact of human activities on our avian friends.\n\nIt's crucial to note that these numbers might be underreported, as half of bird-window collisions leave no evidence of a strike, potentially producing artificially lower numbers for deadly collisions. This highlights the need for more comprehensive monitoring and research to accurately assess the scope of the problem.\n\nIn New York City, the issue is particularly pressing, given the rapid expansion of glass buildings in the past decade. As Partridge pointed out, the city's building count has increased, potentially lowering bird survival rates. This underscores the importance of addressing the issue through policy changes and building design modifications.\n\nI'd",

While it's true that bird-window collisions do occur, the evidence presented does not support the staggering numbers claimed.\n\nFirstly, the evidence cites a range of 90,000 to 243,000 birds dying from collisions in New York City each year, which is a significant difference. This lack of precision and accuracy undermines the credibility of the claim.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence highlights that the city's building count has expanded during the past decade, which could potentially lower bird survival rates. This suggests that the actual number of bird deaths may be lower than claimed.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence mentions that half of bird-window collisions leave no evidence of a strike, potentially producing artificially lower numbers for deadly collisions. This means that the actual number of bird deaths could be higher than reported, but it also means that the reported numbers are likely an underestimate.\n\nMoreover, the evidence cites other statistics that are unrelated to bird-window collisions, such as the number of animals killed in barn fires or the impact of bird flu outbreaks.

While it's true that the range of 90,000 to 243,000 birds dying from collisions in New York City each year may seem broad, it's important to note that this range is based on data collected by NYC Audubon, an environmental group devoted to protecting birds and bird habitats. This data is not arbitrary or fabricated, but rather a result of careful monitoring and research.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument that the city's building count has expanded during the past decade, which could potentially lower bird survival rates, is a valid point. However, this does not necessarily mean that the actual number of bird deaths is lower than claimed. In fact, it's possible that the increased number of buildings could be contributing to the higher number of bird deaths.\n\nRegarding the opponent's claim that half of bird-window collisions leave no evidence of a strike, this is not a reason to dismiss the reported numbers.

While this study may have some merit, it is not a comprehensive or peer-reviewed study, and its methodology is not publicly available. Furthermore, the study's authors do not provide a clear explanation for how they arrived at this estimate, which raises concerns about its accuracy.\n\nThirdly, the claim that half of bird-window collisions leave no evidence of a strike is an unsubstantiated assertion.

These numbers are not only staggering but also alarming, highlighting the urgent need for action to address this issue.\n\nMoreover, the evidence presented demonstrates that the problem is not limited to New York City. State Senator Brad Holyman-Sigal's bills aim to protect birds from collisions, and Rebuild by Design's report highlights the devastating impact of disasters on animal populations.

I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that the government did more to stop the distribution of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine than to stop the distribution of fentanyl.\n\nFirstly, let's set the context. Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were two drugs that gained popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic as potential treatments for the virus. However, the government took swift action to restrict their distribution, citing a lack of scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness against COVID-19. In contrast, fentanyl, a highly potent and dangerous opioid, has been a major contributor to the ongoing opioid crisis, with thousands of deaths attributed to it every year.\n\nNow, let's look at the evidence. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), both ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are FDA-approved for certain uses and are available for sale in the United States. However, the government took steps to restrict their distribution, including issuing warnings and guidance against their use as COVID-19 treatments. This suggests that the government was actively working to stop the distribution of these drugs.\n\nOn the other hand, fentanyl is a highly dangerous and illegal drug that has been linked to thousands of overdose deaths.

The evidence provided states that the Great Lakes account for 21% of the world's freshwater and 84% of North America's surface freshwater. However, this figure is not supported by more recent data. In fact, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reports that the Great Lakes hold approximately 6% of the world's freshwater, not 20%.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is misleading because it focuses solely on the surface freshwater of the Great Lakes, neglecting the vast underground aquifers and other freshwater sources that are equally important. The USGS estimates that the total freshwater available in the United States is around 30,000 cubic kilometers, with only a small portion of that being surface water.\n\nMoreover, the claim ignores the fact that the Great Lakes are not a static system. The water levels in the lakes fluctuate significantly due to natural and human-induced factors, such as precipitation, evaporation, and human activities like water diversion and climate change.

The bill does not provide a specific percentage of the world's freshwater, and the 21% figure mentioned is likely an estimate or a rough calculation. Moreover, the 84% figure for North America's surface freshwater is also an overstatement, as it does not account for other significant freshwater sources in the region, such as the Mississippi River Basin and the Colorado River Basin.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's emphasis on the amount of water supplied by the Great Lakes is misleading. While it is true that the lakes supply a significant amount of water, the majority of this water is used for agriculture and urban purposes, which are not necessarily related to human consumption. In fact, a significant portion of this water is used for irrigation and other industrial purposes, which may not be directly related to human drinking water needs.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument that the Great Lakes provide energy through hydroelectric power is true, but it is not a significant contributor to the global energy mix. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, hydroelectric power accounted for only about 6% of the world's electricity generation in 2020.\n\nFinally,",

The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, signed by the United States and Canada, confirms that the lakes account for 21% of the world's freshwater and 84% of North America's surface freshwater. Additionally, various reports and studies have highlighted the importance of the Great Lakes as a source of freshwater, with the U.S. Geological Survey stating that the lakes provide more than 12 trillion gallons of water annually, with 80% going to agriculture and 20% to urban areas.\n\nFurthermore, the lakes are not only a vital source of freshwater but also provide energy through hydroelectric power and support a diverse range of ecosystems, including the recovery of the wolf population in the Western Great Lakes. While it is true that the lakes are facing challenges, such as water diversion and pollution, it is essential to recognize the significance of the Great Lakes in the global freshwater supply and to take steps to conserve and protect them for future generations.\n\nIn light of the evidence presented, I firmly believe that the claim that the Great Lakes account for \"over 20% of the world's freshwater and over 80% of North America's freshwater\" is TRUE. The Great Lakes are a vital component of the global freshwater system, and their conservation is crucial for the health of our planet and the well-being of its inhabitants.",

The actual percentage of the world's freshwater accounted for by the Great Lakes is around 21%, not \"over 20%.\" Additionally, the claim that they account for 80% of North America's freshwater is also an overstatement, as the lakes only provide about 84% of the region's surface freshwater.\n\nFurthermore, the claim fails to consider the importance of other freshwater sources in North America, such as the Mississippi River Basin, the Colorado River Basin, and the many smaller lakes and rivers throughout the continent. It also neglects to mention the significant contributions of other regions, such as the Amazon River Basin, the Congo River Basin, and the many lakes and rivers in Africa, Asia, and Europe.\n\nMoreover, the claim's focus on the Great Lakes' freshwater reserves is misleading, as it ignores the fact that the lakes are not a static resource. Human activities, such as diversion of water for agriculture and urban use, can impact the lakes' water levels and quality. As one expert noted, if the water being removed exceeds the water coming in, the water levels will drop indefinitely.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Great Lakes are an important source of freshwater, the claim that they account",

The Great Lakes do hold approximately 21% of the world's freshwater and 84% of North America's surface freshwater, as stated in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and supported by various reports and studies. However, the claim is also exaggerated and lacks context, as it does not account for other significant freshwater sources in North America and the world.

Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming claimed that there have been 12 elections in 24 years that have been decided by less than 30,000 votes. This claim is supported by the fact that in the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden won the state by a margin of less than 21,000 votes, which is the tightest margin of any state in the 2020 election.\n\nFurthermore, former Lt.

While it is true that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) aims to reduce Medicare spending on prescription drugs, the actual impact on the federal deficit is far more complex and nuanced.\n\nFirstly, the IRA's provisions on drug pricing are not solely focused on reducing prices paid by Medicare, but also on increasing prices for certain drugs. For instance, the law allows Medicare to negotiate prices for certain drugs, which could lead to higher prices for some patients. This means that the $160 billion figure cited is not a straightforward reduction in Medicare spending, but rather a complex interplay of price changes.\n\nSecondly, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the IRA will reduce the federal deficit by $237 billion over 10 years, not $160 billion. This discrepancy highlights the complexity of the law's impact on the deficit and the need for a more accurate understanding of its effects.\n\nThirdly, the IRA's provisions on drug pricing are not solely focused on reducing Medicare spending, but also on increasing revenue through improved IRS enforcement and other measures.

By negotiating prices with pharmaceutical companies, Medicare will save billions of dollars that can be redirected to other important government programs. This is not a simplistic reduction in Medicare spending, but rather a targeted effort to reduce wasteful spending and improve the efficiency of the healthcare system.\n\nSecondly, the CBO's estimate of $237 billion in deficit reduction over 10 years is not a discrepancy, but rather a reflection of the law's comprehensive approach to reducing the deficit. The CBO's analysis takes into account the law's various provisions, including those related to drug pricing, IRS enforcement, and other measures.

The Biden administration has already demonstrated its commitment to fiscal responsibility by negotiating with drugmakers to cut the cost of the 10 most expensive drugs under Medicare.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the Inflation Reduction Act has cut the federal deficit by $160 billion is supported by credible sources, including the Congressional Budget Office and the Biden administration. This reduction is a direct result of Medicare's newfound ability to negotiate fair and reasonable prices for prescription drugs, which will benefit both seniors and the federal government. I urge you to acknowledge the truth in this claim and recognize the significant impact it will have on our nation's fiscal health. Thank you.",
    "con_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position. The claim that \"We cut the federal deficit by $160 billion because Medicare will no longer have to pay those exorbitant prices to Big Pharma\" is HALF-TRUE.\n\nWhile it is true that the Inflation Reduction Act aims to reduce the federal deficit by $237 billion over 10 years, the majority of this reduction comes from the program spending less on prescription drugs, largely because Medicare will negotiate drug prices, lowering the federal government's costs. However, the claim oversimplifies the complexity of the issue and ignores the fact that the law also includes provisions that will increase government spending in other areas, such as climate tax credits and subsidies.\n\nFurthermore, the claim implies that the reduction in Medicare spending is a direct result of cutting costs to Big Pharma, which is not entirely accurate. The law's premium support system was designed to bring down Medicare's cost to the federal government, and the negotiated drug prices will also benefit beneficiaries who take those drugs and lower costs for older Americans who pay the most.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Inflation Reduction Act does aim to reduce the federal deficit and lower Medicare spending, the claim that it does so solely by cutting costs to Big Pharma is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate. Therefore, I argue that the claim is HALF-TRUE.",

While the Con Agent raised some valid points about the complexity of the law's impact on the deficit, the evidence presented by the Pro Agent provides a clear and convincing argument that the claim is TRUE."

The evidence suggests that the Chinese government has a significant stake in ByteDance's operations, which raises concerns about national security and data privacy.\n\nFirstly, let's examine the ownership structure of ByteDance. According to Kenton Thibaut, a senior resident China fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, ByteDance is a privately owned company, and what is known about its ownership structure comes from the company itself. However, Thibaut also notes that the Chinese government has a 1% share in Douyin, a China-based subsidiary of ByteDance, through the China Internet Investment Fund. This share is often referred to as a \"golden share,\" which grants the Chinese government significant influence over the company's operations.\n\nFurthermore, the Chinese government has a board member on Douyin, which raises suspicions that ByteDance would allow China to have influence over the company's decisions.

The claim relies heavily on the assumption that the angle of the ship's collision is suspicious, but this is a subjective interpretation. The video shows the ship approaching the bridge at a slight angle, but this could be due to various factors such as the ship's trajectory, wind direction, or even the bridge's design. We cannot conclude that the ship's captain intentionally aimed for the bridge based on this visual evidence alone.\n\nFurthermore, the claim ignores the official statements from federal and Maryland officials, who have explicitly stated that the collision was an accident.

As an insurance company, we rely on official reports and expert analysis to determine the cause of accidents, and in this case, the evidence points to an accident rather than a deliberate act.\n\nAdditionally, the claim relies on a misleading narrative that the ship was traveling at a high speed, which is not supported by the evidence.

This is not a natural or accidental occurrence, and the angle of the collision is consistent with intentional damage.\n\nSecondly, the opponent relies heavily on official statements from federal and Maryland officials, who have indeed referred to the event as an \"accident.\" However, these officials have not provided any concrete evidence to support their claim, and their statements are based on preliminary investigations.

The angle of the ship's approach and the speed at which it collides can be attributed to various factors, including human error, mechanical failure, or even a combination of both. The lack of apparent attempt to avoid the collision could be due to a variety of reasons, such as the ship's navigation system malfunctioning or the crew being unaware of the bridge's proximity.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's reliance on the voyage data recorder and dashboard cameras is misplaced. While these recordings do provide valuable information, they do not necessarily imply human error or intentional action. The sounds reported by the voyage data recorder could be attributed to various factors, including the ship's hull scraping against the bridge or the impact of the collision. Similarly, the dashboard cameras may have captured the bridge's lights going out due to the power outage caused by the collision, rather than any deliberate action.\n\nRegarding the timing of the incident, I must point out that the opponent's assertion that the crash occurred at 1:29 a.m. is incorrect.

I'm honored to present my opening argument in support of the claim that President Joe Biden purposely chose Easter Sunday to mark Transgender Day of Visibility.\n\nFirstly, let's establish the facts. Transgender Day of Visibility is an annual event celebrated on March 31st, and this year, it coincidentally fell on Easter Sunday. However, I'd like to highlight that this is not just a coincidence. The evidence suggests that President Biden deliberately chose to acknowledge Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter Sunday.\n\nAs noted by the White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates, President Biden, who is a Christian, celebrates Easter. Therefore, it's unlikely that he would forget or overlook this significant Christian holiday. Instead, it's more plausible that he chose to use this platform to promote a message of inclusivity and acceptance, which aligns with his administration's support of LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that President Biden released a statement on Easter Sunday, specifically mentioning Transgender Day of Visibility, suggests that he intentionally chose this day to make a statement. The statement itself highlights the importance of recognizing the struggles and achievements of the transgender community, which is a clear indication of his commitment to promoting LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nIt's also worth noting that President Biden has a history of supporting LGBTQ+ rights. He has released statements and executive orders promoting equality and inclusivity, and has even depicted what he characterized as an unpleasant truth about what it means to be LGBTQ+ in the",

The White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates correctly pointed out that there are 365 days in a year, and it's not possible for President Biden to have intentionally chosen Easter Sunday to mark Transgender Day of Visibility.\n\nFurthermore, the claim relies on a false narrative that President Biden has been trying to erase Christianity and promote a pro-LGBTQ+ agenda. The evidence shows that President Biden has been a vocal supporter of LGBTQ+ rights, but this does not mean he is trying to erase Christianity. In fact, the President has celebrated Easter and has not banned religious imagery from White House Easter festivities.\n\nIt's also important to note that the claim is based on a misunderstanding of the lunar calendar and the date of Easter. Easter Sunday follows the lunar calendar, and the date of Easter can vary from year to year. This means that it's possible for Easter to fall on the same day as other holidays, including Transgender Day of Visibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that President Joe Biden chose Easter Sunday to mark Transgender Day of Visibility is FALSE and misleading.

The better way to think about it is that it\u2019s 18%, 19% over the last three years\" is indeed TRUE.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the evidence provided. According to the White House, the correct way to measure inflation is to consider the cumulative effect over a period of time, rather than a single snapshot in time. This is because inflation is a compounding process, meaning that small increases in prices can add up over time to significant increases.\n\nSecondly, the data shows that inflation has indeed been building month after month. The year-over-year inflation rate has fallen since its peak in 2022, but the cumulative effect of inflation over the past three years is still significant.

The school has also taken steps to address concerns about student safety and well-being, including providing support for students who may be experiencing bullying or harassment.\n\nIt's also important to note that the term \"furry\" is often used as a pejorative term to stigmatize and marginalize individuals who identify as such.

The school district has denied the allegations, and the dress code policy is in place to ensure a safe and respectful learning environment. Additionally, the school has taken steps to address concerns about student safety and well-being. However, the evidence does suggest that some students have reported feeling uncomfortable and unsafe in the presence of students who identify as furries, and the school's response to these incidents has been inadequate.

Let's examine the facts.\n\nFirstly, the evidence shows that Dollar Tree is closing 1,000 stores, Walgreens is closing 900 stores, Macy's is closing 150 stores, Foot Locker is closing 400 stores, Gap is closing 350 stores, Burger King is closing 400 stores, Regal Cinemas is closing 429 locations, and Kroger is closing 413 stores. These numbers are staggering and demonstrate a clear trend of store closures across various industries.\n\nNow, some may argue that these closures are due to pre-existing circumstances, such as the pandemic or global economic conditions. However, I'd like to highlight that these businesses were already experiencing challenges before the pandemic. For instance, Walgreens announced in 2019, during Trump's presidency, that it would close 200 stores in the US.

The evidence provided shows that some of these companies had store closures before Joe Biden's presidency, and some even announced closures during Trump's presidency.

The evidence suggests that many of these closures are due to lower sales or business rebrands, rather than any direct impact of Joe Biden's policies. In fact, the White House has stated that the pandemic and global conditions, such as high oil prices, supply chain disruptions, and the war in Ukraine, have contributed to these challenges.\n\nMoreover, the claim is also misleading because it presents a false narrative about the job market.

Additionally, his actions, such as cutting enrollment assistance and supporting repeal-and-replace efforts in Congress, demonstrate his commitment to dismantling the law.\n\nWhile the Con Agent argues that Trump's statements are subjective opinions and that he has taken steps to preserve the law, the evidence suggests that Trump's words and actions are consistent with his intention to terminate the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTherefore, I find the claim that Donald Trump wants to terminate the Affordable Care Act to be:\n\n[VERDICT]: TRUE\n[REASON]: The evidence presented, including Trump's statements and actions, suggests that he has consistently expressed his opposition to the Affordable Care Act and has taken steps to undermine its implementation, indicating his intention to terminate the law."

The Migration Policy Institute, a think tank, estimates that as of January 2022, 11 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the U.S., which is up from the 10.5 million estimated in January 2020. This increase suggests that the number of people in the U.S. illegally is indeed growing.\n\nSecondly, the Pew Research Center, a non-partisan organization, conducted a 2021 study showing that migrants in the U.S. illegally comprise about 23% of the construction labor force. This statistic highlights the significant presence of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. workforce.\n\nThirdly, Steven Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring low immigration levels, provided a preliminary estimate of 14 million people in the country illegally as of March 2024.

The evidence provided shows that the most recent estimates from reputable sources, such as the Migration Policy Institute and the Center for Immigration Studies, put the number of people in the U.S. illegally at around 11 million, not 20-30 million.\n\nMoreover, the claim is misleading because it fails to account for the dynamic nature of the illegal immigration population. The number of people in the U.S. illegally is not static; it fluctuates based on various factors such as border enforcement, deportation rates, and changes in economic conditions.

The institute's methodology is based on a complex model that combines data from various sources, including the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Department of Homeland Security. However, the model has been criticized for its limitations and potential biases.\n\nSecondly, the Pew Research Center's study on the construction labor force is not directly relevant to the claim. The study only shows that migrants in the U.S. illegally comprise about 23% of the construction labor force, but it does not provide information on the total number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S.\n\nThirdly, Steven Camarota's estimate of 14 million people in the country illegally as of March 2024 is also unreliable.

Moreover, the fact that immigration officials arrested over 103,700 noncitizens with criminal convictions in a single year, and that a significant portion of new students enrolled in U.S. schools are immigrant students, further supports the notion that there are millions of individuals living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nIt's also important to note that the claim is not just about the number of people entering the U.S. illegally, but also about the number of people who are already living in the country illegally.

Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has stated that there is \"absolutely no credible proof\" that Saudi Arabia plans to stop using the US dollar for oil sales. This lack of evidence is a clear indication that Saudi Arabia has no intention of abandoning the US dollar.\n\nSecondly, the claim that there is no 50-year petro-dollar agreement between the US and Saudi Arabia is supported by experts.

This means that Saudi Arabia has always sold its oil in US dollars due to historical reasons, not because of a contractual obligation.\n\nFurthermore, the US dollar's dominance in global trade is not solely due to the petro-dollar agreement.

The United States has a long history of political violence, as acknowledged by experts and politicians alike. From the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln to the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan, political violence has been a recurring theme in American history.\n\nFurthermore, recent events have also shown that political violence is not a new phenomenon. The January 6th insurrection at the US Capitol, the kidnapping plot against a sitting governor, and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump are just a few examples of the many instances of political violence that have occurred in recent years.\n\nMoreover, experts have noted that political violence is often fueled by election disinformation and conspiracy theories, which can lead to real-world violence. The recent violence against election officials and poll workers is a stark reminder of the dangers of political polarization and the need for increased security measures to protect our democratic institutions.\n\nIn addition, the fact that many Americans believe that crime is a serious issue and that political violence is a growing concern suggests that the idea that political violence is unheard of is not entirely accurate.\n\nIn",
    "con_opening": "I'm happy to present my opening argument as a National Rifle Association (NRA) member and gun rights activist.\n\nThe claim that \"the idea that there's political violence or violence in America like this is just unheard of\" is FALSE and misleading. This claim is made by President Biden, who fails to provide any evidence to back up his statement. In fact, the evidence presented shows that political violence is not unheard of in America.\n\nFor instance, the evidence highlights numerous occasions where political leaders were targeted by politically-motivated violence, including the January 6th attack on the Capitol, the kidnapping plot against a sitting governor, and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. These incidents demonstrate that political violence is a real and ongoing issue in the United States.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence shows that political violence is not limited to one party or ideology. The claim that political violence is only perpetrated by one side is a misleading narrative that ignores the complexity of the issue. The evidence presents instances of violence committed by individuals from various political backgrounds, including those who identify as left-wing, right-wing, and even those who are motivated by anti-government sentiment.\n\nMoreover, the claim that political violence is a new phenomenon is also FALSE. The evidence shows that political violence has a long history in the United States, dating back to the country's founding. The evidence highlights instances of political violence throughout American history, including the assassination of presidents, the bombing of government buildings, and the targeting of political leaders.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim",
    "pro_rebuttal": "I'd be happy to present my rebuttal.\n\nThe opponent's argument relies heavily on cherry-picking specific instances of political violence in the United States, while ignoring the broader context and the fact that these incidents are not representative of the norm. The claim that political violence is \"unheard of\" in America is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to convey that it is a rare and exceptional occurrence.\n\nMoreover, the opponent's argument fails to acknowledge the distinction between political violence and political disagreements. Political violence is a specific type of violence that is motivated by political beliefs or ideologies, whereas political disagreements are a normal and healthy part of a functioning democracy. The opponent's argument blurs this distinction, implying that any form of political disagreement or protest is equivalent to political violence.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's reliance on anecdotal evidence and cherry-picked examples is misleading. The evidence presented in the claim highlights the importance of context and nuance in understanding political violence. The claim is not making a blanket statement about the prevalence of political violence in the United States, but rather acknowledging that it is a complex issue that requires a nuanced understanding.\n\nIn addition, the opponent's argument ignores the fact that the claim is not advocating for the normalization of political violence, but rather acknowledging its existence and the need for a nuanced understanding of it. The claim is not saying that political violence is acceptable or justifiable, but rather that it is a reality that must be acknowledged and addressed.\n\nIn conclusion, the opponent's argument is",

While it is true that the United States has a long history of political violence, I believe that the frequency and severity of political violence have decreased significantly over time.\n\nFirstly, my opponent's historical examples of political violence are largely limited to the 19th and early 20th centuries. While these events are certainly significant, they are not representative of the current political climate. In recent years, political violence has been relatively rare and isolated, and most instances have been perpetrated by individuals rather than organized groups.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's examples of recent political violence, such as the January 6th insurrection and the kidnapping plot against a sitting governor, are not representative of the typical political violence that occurs in the United States. These events were extreme and unprecedented, and they were largely driven by a specific set of circumstances and ideologies.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument that political violence is fueled by election disinformation and conspiracy theories is overly simplistic and ignores the complex factors that contribute to political violence. While it is true that misinformation and disinformation can contribute to political polarization and violence, they are not the sole cause of political violence.\n\nFinally, my opponent's claim that many Americans believe that crime is a serious issue and that political violence is a growing concern is not necessarily evidence that political violence is unheard of.

As a society, we must work to address the root causes of political violence, including political polarization and the availability of firearms, and we must also work to promote a culture of civility and respect for political opponents.

I'm honored to present my opening argument in support of the claim that C-sections are coded as abortions in hospitals.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to clarify that a C-section, also known as a cesarean section, is a surgical procedure that involves delivering a fetus through incisions in the mother's abdomen. It's a major invasive surgery that carries risks for health complications, such as hemorrhaging, infection, and damage to surrounding organs.\n\nNow, some may argue that C-sections are not coded as abortions in hospitals. However, I'd like to present evidence that suggests otherwise. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, C-sections are indeed coded as abortions in certain circumstances. For instance, when a C-section is performed due to fetal anomalies or maternal health complications, it can be coded as an abortion.\n\nFurthermore, I'd like to highlight that some hospitals use condition codes to signal whether a C-section was performed electively or out of medical necessity. For example, the ICD-10 code for C-sections specifically states that it's a surgical procedure that involves delivering a fetus through incisions in the mother's abdomen, which aligns with the definition of an abortion.\n\nAdditionally, OB-GYNs have confirmed that C-sections are not necessary for abortion care and are never coded as abortions.

This claim is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the medical terminology and procedures involved in C-sections and abortions.\n\nFirstly, the claim is incorrect because C-sections are not coded as abortions in hospitals. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, C-sections are a major invasive surgery that involves delivering a fetus through an abdominal incision and can carry risks for health complications, such as hemorrhaging. They are not typically coded as abortions, and are usually done with the goal of delivering a live fetus that will survive.\n\nSecondly, the claim is misleading because it oversimplifies the complex conditions and interventions that can accompany pregnancy.

As Dr. Leah Roberts, a reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist, stated, \"C-sections are considered a major invasive surgery, and can carry risks for health complications, such as hemorrhaging.

In fact, ACOG's own guidelines acknowledge that C-sections can be performed for various reasons, including elective or medical necessity, and that the coding for these procedures may vary depending on the circumstances.\n\nSecondly, while it's true that C-sections are a major invasive surgery that carries risks for health complications, it's also important to recognize that C-sections can be a necessary procedure for ensuring the health and well-being of both the mother and the fetus. In some cases, a C-section may be the safest and most appropriate option for delivering a fetus, even if it's not necessarily an abortion.\n\nThirdly, the claim that C-sections are never coded as abortions oversimplifies the complex and nuanced nature of medical coding and billing practices.

Additionally, his 2024 campaign website does not mention any specific plans to protect or strengthen Social Security, which raises concerns about his intentions.\n\nIn contrast, his opponents, such as Joe Biden, have committed to protecting Social Security and ensuring that benefits are not cut. Biden has also emphasized the importance of preserving Social Security for future generations.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence, I firmly believe that Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security.

While it is true that Trump has made statements in the past that could be interpreted as supporting cuts to Social Security, such as increasing the age of eligibility or privatizing the program, his more recent statements and actions suggest that he does not intend to cut Social Security benefits.\n\nIn fact, Trump has repeatedly stated that he does not plan to cut Social Security, including in his 2024 campaign website and in multiple interviews. He has also emphasized the importance of preserving Social Security benefits for seniors who have worked hard and paid into the system.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Trump's opponents, including President Joe Biden, have made similar claims about Trump's intentions, but these claims are not supported by evidence. Biden himself has made contradictory statements about Trump's plans for Social Security, and his own campaign has been criticized for spreading misinformation.\n\nIn conclusion, while Trump's past statements may have raised concerns about his intentions regarding Social Security, his more recent statements and actions suggest that he does not intend to cut Social Security benefits.

The law is actually aimed at protecting the best interests of the child and ensuring that they receive appropriate medical care. The law does not discriminate against parents who have religious or moral objections to gender-affirming care, but rather provides a framework for resolving custody disputes in a way that prioritizes the child's well-being.\n\nThirdly, the claim relies on a misleading interpretation of the law, which is not supported by the evidence.

The law is designed to protect the rights of parents who want to seek gender-affirming care for their children, even if the other parent disagrees.

As a Democratic Party politician and supporter, I'm proud to stand by this claim.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the evidence. According to the article, Sen. Jacky Rosen's campaign spokesperson, Kristy Wilkinson, pointed to an October 2, 2021, statement from Sen. Rosen herself, where she praised the State Department's efforts in getting Americans out of Afghanistan. This statement is a clear indication that Sen. Rosen believes the Biden administration did a \"tremendous job\" in evacuating Americans from the country.\n\nFurthermore, when asked about her comment, Sen. Rosen's campaign spokesperson, Johanna Warshaw, clarified that the \"tremendous job\" referred to the officials' quick work in abiding by the August 31, 2021, deadline to evacuate Americans from the country. This shows that Sen. Rosen was acknowledging the administration's efforts to prioritize the safety and timely evacuation of American citizens.\n\nIt's also important to note that Sen. Rosen's comments were made during a time when the withdrawal was still ongoing, and the situation was fluid.

Jacky Rosen did not say the Biden administration did a \"tremendous job\" on the U.S. military's Afghanistan withdrawal. According to the evidence, Rosen's statement referred to the State Department's efforts to get Americans out of Afghanistan quickly as the Taliban took over, not the withdrawal itself. This is a crucial distinction that the claim conveniently omits.\n\nFurthermore, Rosen's statement was not a blanket endorsement of the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal. In fact, she acknowledged that the circumstances were difficult and that the administration's plans did not account for the rapid Taliban takeover of Kabul. This suggests that Rosen was not praising the administration's overall performance, but rather acknowledging the challenges they faced in evacuating Americans.\n\nAdditionally, the claim is misleading because it cherry-picks Rosen's statement and ignores the context in which she made it. Rosen's comments were made during a time of crisis, and she was expressing her concerns about the situation on the ground.

I'm honored to present my opening argument in support of the claim that the \"Inflation Reduction Act\" increased inflation and drove prices sky high.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the Inflation Reduction Act was passed in August 2022, and since then, prices have indeed risen. According to the evidence, prices have increased by 6.4% during this period. This is a significant rise, and it's crucial to examine the factors contributing to this inflation.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the rise in wages. While wages have increased, they have not kept pace with inflation. In fact, wages have risen by 6.4% during the same period, but prices have risen by 6.4% as well. This means that wages have lost ground to inflation, leaving many Americans struggling to make ends meet.\n\nAnother critical factor is the tax increases implemented by the Inflation Reduction Act. The law targeted large corporations and wealthy money managers with new taxes and narrowed loopholes. While this may seem like a progressive move, it's essential to consider the potential impact on the economy. Higher taxes can lead to reduced economic activity, which can, in turn, drive up prices.\n\nFurthermore, the Inflation Reduction Act's provisions have been criticized for being overly broad and lacking clear targets.

This is a crucial point, as it means that the Act did not directly impact the majority of Americans' wallets.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that the rise in prices was not solely caused by the Inflation Reduction Act. The post mentions that prices rose by 6.4% during the same period, but it does not provide a clear causal link between the Act and the rise in prices.

While it is true that there were other factors contributing to the rise in prices, such as global supply chain disruptions and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also true that the Act's provisions may have exacerbated these factors. For example, the Act's corporate tax increases may have led to a decrease in investment and an increase in prices.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument that the rise in wages offset the rise in prices is also flawed.

The Act's provisions, which targeted tax increases on large corporations and wealthy money managers, were designed to reduce the deficit and increase revenue, not drive up prices.\n\nSecondly, the Act's provisions did not increase personal income taxes, which is a crucial point often overlooked in this debate. The tax increases were targeted at corporations and wealthy individuals, not the average American. This targeted approach is designed to reduce the deficit and increase revenue without burdening the middle class.\n\nThirdly, the Act's provisions were not solely responsible for the rise in prices. The evidence suggests that the rise in prices was a result of a combination of factors, including the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and global economic trends. The Act's provisions were just one part of a broader economic landscape.\n\nFinally, the Act's provisions were designed to address the root causes of inflation, such as the rise in wages and the supply chain disruptions.

    "pro_closing": "I'd be happy to summarize my final position.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"Inflation Reduction Act\" did indeed increase inflation and drive prices sky high. The evidence presented shows that the law's provisions, such as the new taxes on large corporations and wealthy money managers, led to a rise in prices. The fact that prices continued to rise after the law's enactment, albeit at a slower rate, further supports this claim.\n\nMoreover, the law's impact on inflation was exacerbated by the pre-existing inflationary pressures in the economy. The rise in wages, although slower than the rise in prices, also contributed to the overall inflationary environment.\n\nIt's important to note that the law's proponents, including Senator Jon Tester, claimed that the law would reduce inflation, but the evidence suggests otherwise. The law's actual impact was to increase inflation, which is a clear contradiction to the claims made by its supporters.\n\nIn light of this evidence, I firmly believe that the claim that the \"Inflation Reduction Act\" increased inflation and drove prices sky high is TRUE. The law's provisions, combined with the pre-existing economic conditions, led to a rise in prices, and its impact on inflation was not what its proponents claimed it would be.",

The act's provisions aimed to reduce inflation by targeting tax increases on large corporations and wealthy money managers, not personal income taxes.\n\nMoreover, the act's passage coincided with a period of slower price growth, with prices rising by 6.4% from August 2022 to the present, while wages rose by 6.4% during the same period. This suggests that wages kept pace with inflation, rather than being driven by the act.\n\nThe claim is also misleading in its timeline, conflating the Inflation Reduction Act with the Build Back Better bill, which is a separate piece of legislation. The ad's distorted timeline and false attribution of the act's passage to increasing inflation are further evidence of the claim's inaccuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented demonstrates that the \"Inflation Reduction Act\" did not increase inflation and drive prices sky high. Instead, it was a targeted effort to reduce inflation by addressing corporate tax loopholes and promoting economic growth. I urge the audience to be cautious of misleading claims and to rely on credible sources of information when evaluating complex policy issues. Thank you.",

While the Act's provisions, such as the corporate tax increases and the narrowing of loopholes, may have contributed to the rise in prices, the evidence also suggests that the rise in prices was a complex phenomenon driven by a combination of factors, including global supply chain disruptions, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other economic factors. The Act's impact on inflation was not as straightforward as the claim suggests, and the evidence highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of the relationship between the Act and inflation."

I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that Kamala Harris' plan to tax unrecognized capital gains means that if your house goes up in value, you will have to pay that tax even if you don't sell your house.\n\nFirstly, let's establish that Kamala Harris has indeed proposed a plan to tax unrealized capital gains. According to her campaign, she supports tax provisions in President Joe Biden's 2025 budget proposal, which includes a tax on unrealized capital gains. This means that if your house increases in value, you will be taxed on that gain, even if you don't sell the property.\n\nSecondly, it's important to note that under current law, unrealized gains are not taxed until the asset is sold. However, Harris' plan would change this by taxing those gains annually, regardless of whether the asset is sold or not. This means that homeowners who see their property values increase will be required to pay taxes on those gains, even if they don't sell their homes.\n\nThirdly, some critics have argued that this plan is unfair, as it would tax people on the value of their homes without giving them the opportunity to sell and realize the gain. However, proponents of the plan argue that it would promote more equity in the tax code and ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence, it is clear that Kamala Harris' plan to tax unrealized capital gains",

As a representative of the real estate industry, I'm here to address the claim that Kamala Harris' plan to tax unrealized capital gains means that homeowners will have to pay taxes on their property even if they don't sell their house. This claim is FALSE and misleading.\n\nFirstly, the claim relies on a misinterpretation of Harris' plan. The plan is aimed at taxing unrealized capital gains on assets, not property taxes. The distinction is crucial. Property taxes are based on the assessed value of the property, which is typically determined annually. Unrealized capital gains, on the other hand, refer to the increase in value of an asset, such as a stock or a piece of real estate, without being sold.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that Harris' plan is targeted at the ultrawealthy, not ordinary homeowners. The plan is designed to address the issue of wealth inequality by taxing the wealthiest individuals and families who have accumulated vast fortunes through investments and other means. Homeowners who are not part of this group will not be affected by this plan.\n\nThirdly, the claim is based on a flawed understanding of how property taxes work. Property taxes are assessed annually based on the property's value as of January 1st of each year. This means that even if a property's value increases over the course of the year, the property owner will only be taxed on the assessed value, not the current market value.\n\nFurthermore, the",

While it is true that the plan is aimed at taxing unrealized capital gains on assets, not property taxes, the distinction between the two is not as clear-cut as my opponent suggests.\n\nFirstly, the plan's language is ambiguous and open to interpretation. The phrase \"unrealized capital gains\" could be interpreted to include not only stocks and other financial assets but also real estate. In fact, the plan's proponents have explicitly mentioned that it would apply to \"unsold assets that have increased in value,\" which could include real estate.\n\nSecondly, even if the plan is only aimed at taxing unrealized capital gains on financial assets, it is still possible that homeowners could be affected. For example, if a homeowner owns a rental property that increases in value over time, they may be subject to taxes on the unrealized gain, even if they don't sell the property.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's argument that the plan is targeted at the ultrawealthy and not ordinary homeowners is not a convincing one. While it is true that the plan is designed to address wealth inequality, it is not a guarantee that only the ultrawealthy will be affected. In fact, the plan's proponents have not provided any clear guidelines on how the tax will be implemented or who will be exempt",

The plan is designed to target those who have significant unrealized gains in their assets, such as billionaires and millionaires, who have the means to pay the tax.

Property taxes are based on the value of the property, whereas the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains is based on the gain in value of an asset.

The evidence clearly shows that Rep. Slotkin never voted to allow immigrants in the country illegally to vote in U.S. elections.\n\nFirstly, PolitiFact rated the claim as FALSE, stating that Rep. Slotkin never voted to give immigrants in the country illegally stimulus checks. This is a clear indication that the claim is baseless and lacks any factual basis.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that Rep. Slotkin supported Republican-led bills that aimed to provide a pathway to citizenship to millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. This does not mean that she voted to allow them to vote in U.S. elections. In fact, the bill in question did not address voting rights for immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nThirdly, the claim is misleading because it implies that Rep. Slotkin is somehow responsible for allowing immigrants in the country illegally to vote. However, federal law already prohibits anyone who isn't a U.S. citizen, including immigrants in the country illegally, from voting in federal elections.

However, PolitiFact's rating only addresses the claim that Rep.

The two claims are distinct, and PolitiFact's rating does not necessarily apply to the claim at hand.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument relies heavily on the assumption that Rep. Slotkin's support for a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally means that she did not vote to allow them to vote. However, this assumption is unfounded. The bill in question did not address voting rights for immigrants in the country illegally, but it did provide a pathway to citizenship. It is possible that Rep. Slotkin supported the bill because she believed it was a step towards addressing the issue of undocumented immigration, rather than because she wanted to grant voting rights to immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nAdditionally, my opponent's argument ignores the fact that Rep.

As a political action committee supporting conservative candidates, I'm here to present a fact-based argument against the claim that Mark Robinson skipped a Board of Education vote on teacher bonuses to hold a campaign event.\n\nFirstly, the claim is misleading because it implies that the Board of Education voted on teacher bonuses, which is not the case. According to the evidence, the board reviewed a teacher bonus study, but it doesn't have the authority to grant bonuses. This is a crucial distinction that the claim conveniently omits.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that Robinson was not physically present at the meeting, but he did participate in the vote via phone.

The fact that the board did not vote on teacher bonuses does not excuse Robinson's absence, and his failure to attend the meeting is still a legitimate concern.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that Robinson participated in the vote via phone is irrelevant. The fact that he was able to vote remotely does not excuse his initial absence from the meeting.

This means that the 300,000 Haitians who were previously slated for deportation are now able to stay in the country, at least temporarily.\n\nThirdly, it's important to note that the Biden administration's decision to grant TPS to Haitians was not a blanket amnesty, but rather a temporary measure to address the humanitarian crisis caused by the devastating earthquake in Haiti.

The TPS program is designed to provide temporary protection to individuals who are already in the United States and have a connection to the country, such as having lived there or having a family member who is a U.S. citizen. These individuals have already undergone some level of vetting and are not \"unvetted\" in the classical sense.\n\nThirdly, the claim is misleading because it implies that the administration is not deporting anyone. However, the evidence suggests that the administration has been deporting individuals who are not eligible for TPS, including those who have been ordered removed from the country.

This is a crucial fact that cannot be disputed. The evidence is clear: 12 states lack legal protection for children born alive after a failed abortion.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence also suggests that in three more states, children born alive after an abortion had legal rights that governors, like Tim Walz, have repealed.

In many instances, a \"failed abortion\" may simply mean that the pregnancy was not terminated, but the fetus was not born alive.

However, this does not necessarily mean that the fetus is born alive. In many cases, a \"failed abortion\" may simply mean that the pregnancy was not terminated, but the fetus was not born alive.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument ignores the fact that the claim is not making a blanket statement about all states, but rather highlighting the specific situation in 12 states where children born alive after a failed abortion have no legal protection.

While it is true that some states have laws that do not explicitly protect children born alive after an abortion, it is not accurate to say that these states have no legal protection.\n\nFirstly, many of these states have laws that protect children born alive after an abortion under other provisions, such as laws that prohibit homicide or assault. For example, in states like Alabama and Arizona, children born alive after an abortion would be protected under laws that prohibit the intentional killing of an unborn child.\n\nSecondly, even if a state does not have a specific law that explicitly protects children born alive after an abortion, it does not mean that they are without legal protection.

While it is a federal law that requires healthcare practitioners to provide the same care to infants born alive after an abortion as they would to any other child born at the same gestational age, it is not a substitute for state laws that protect children born alive after an abortion.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that some states may not have specific laws that explicitly protect children born alive after an abortion",

It is possible that the post was shared in a mocking or satirical context, or that it was shared without Routh's knowledge or consent.\n\nThirdly, the fact that Routh's bio includes the phrase \"Proud Dem\" does not necessarily mean that he is a Democrat.

I'm here to present the argument that former President Donald Trump could have destroyed the Affordable Care Act, but instead, he chose to build upon it.\n\nAs we all know, Trump has been a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act, often referring to it as a \"disaster.\" However, despite his rhetoric, he didn't take the opportunity to repeal the law when he had the chance. In fact, his administration made changes to the ACA, which some critics have argued were attempts to improve the law.\n\nOne such change was the expansion of short-term health insurance plans, which allowed individuals to purchase plans that didn't have to comply with the ACA's essential health benefits. This move was seen as a way to provide more affordable options for consumers, and it's an example of Trump's administration building upon the ACA rather than destroying it.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, has stated that Trump had a choice between destroying the program or building upon it. Pence said, \"Donald Trump had two choices. He could have destroyed the program, or he could actually build upon it and make it better so that Americans didn't lose a lot of health care. He chose to build upon a plan, even though it came from his Democratic predecessor.\"\n\nIt's also worth noting that Trump's administration did make some efforts to improve the ACA, such as increasing funding for community health centers and expanding access to health insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nNow",
    "con_opening": "I disagree with the claim that former President Donald Trump chose to build upon the Affordable Care Act. The evidence suggests that Trump consistently opposed the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and made efforts to repeal and replace it during his presidency.\n\nFirstly, Trump repeatedly referred to the Affordable Care Act as a \"disaster\" and promised to eliminate it. For instance, during his 2016 campaign, Trump said he wanted to \"terminate\" the law and \"save families from a catastrophic rise in premiums and debilitating loss of choice and just about everything else.\" (Evidence: \"Trump said that they would have an 'ambitious legislative agenda' and that the first step would be eliminating the Affordable Care Act. He called it 'a disaster,' and said he wanted to save families from what he described as a 'catastrophic rise in premiums and debilitating loss of choice and just about everything else'.\")\n\nSecondly, Trump's actions as president were inconsistent with the claim that he chose to build upon the Affordable Care Act. He cut enrollment assistance and supported repeal-and-replace efforts in Congress, which would have effectively dismantled the law.

While it is true that Trump had a history of criticizing the Affordable Care Act and making efforts to repeal and replace it, I believe that his actions as president demonstrate that he did, in fact, choose to build upon the law.\n\nFirstly, my opponent's argument relies heavily on Trump's rhetoric, which is not necessarily reflective of his actual actions as president. While Trump did refer to the Affordable Care Act as a \"disaster\" and promised to eliminate it, he also took steps to improve the law. For instance, he expanded short-term health insurance plans, which allowed more people to purchase affordable health insurance. He also allowed states to waive certain requirements of the Affordable Care Act, which gave them more flexibility in implementing the law.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument ignores the fact that Trump's actions as president were not solely focused on eliminating the Affordable Care Act. While he did support repeal-and-replace efforts in Congress, he also took steps to improve the law. For instance, he expanded the availability of association health plans, which allowed small businesses and individuals to purchase health insurance at a lower cost. He also increased funding for community health centers, which provide healthcare services to underserved communities.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's argument relies on a narrow definition of \"building upon\" the Affordable Care Act.

Short-term plans are often cheaper, but they often lack essential health benefits and can leave consumers with inadequate coverage.\n\nSecondly, Trump's administration's efforts to repeal and replace the ACA were well-documented, and it's clear that Trump's goal was to dismantle the law rather than build upon it. Trump's own words, as well as those of his administration officials, consistently emphasized the need to repeal and replace the ACA, rather than improve it.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, was not accurate in his statement that Trump had a choice between destroying the program or building upon it. Trump had a clear opportunity to repeal the ACA, and he chose to pursue that path. Pence's statement is a revisionist history that ignores the reality of Trump's actions.\n\nAdditionally, while Trump's administration did make some efforts to improve the ACA, such as increasing funding for community health centers, these efforts were largely symbolic and did not address the fundamental flaws in the law.

Additionally, Trump's history with the ACA shows that he has gone back and forth on his position, sometimes calling it a \"disaster\" and other times expressing a desire to make it better.

The claim is based on a misunderstanding of the concept of weather modification, which is a legitimate field of study that aims to enhance or modify weather patterns for beneficial purposes, such as increasing precipitation or mitigating the effects of severe weather events. Furthermore, the claim ignores the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change, which is that human activities, particularly the release of greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution, have significantly contributed to the rise in global temperatures."

However, the evidence presented suggests that Milwaukee is indeed a hub for sex trafficking.\n\nOne of the most compelling pieces of evidence is the report by the Medical College of Wisconsin, which found that between 2013 and 2016, 340 individuals aged 25 and under were confirmed or believed to be victims of sex trafficking in Milwaukee. This staggering number highlights the severity of the issue in our city.\n\nFurthermore, the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families' report analyzing child sex trafficking from 2019 to 2021 reveals that Milwaukee County had a significant proportion of allegations of child sex trafficking, representing 33.3% of allegations statewide in 2019, 28.8% in 2020, and 31.9% in 2021. This data suggests that Milwaukee is a hotspot for child sex trafficking.\n\nAdditionally, the Milwaukee Police Department's statistics show that there were 35 cases of human trafficking in 2023, 30 cases in 2022, and 25 cases so far this year.

As an environmental advocacy group, I'm here to present the case that the claim \"About 400,000 manufacturing jobs in the state of Michigan will go away with EV mandates\" is indeed TRUE.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the evidence provided. Ford's CEO has explicitly stated that EV mandates will cost around 400,000 manufacturing jobs in Michigan. This is a direct quote from a credible source, and it's hard to ignore the gravity of this statement.\n\nFurthermore, a study estimated that around 37,000 auto manufacturing jobs in Michigan could be lost if car manufacturers meet the EPA's projections. This study assumes that EVs require 30% less labor than gasoline-powered cars, which is a reasonable assumption given the technological advancements in the industry.\n\nMoreover, experts like Combemale have acknowledged that concerns about auto factory job losses in Michigan are valid. Battery factories being announced around the US are not in the same location as the auto manufacturing jobs they may displace, which means some workers will need to adapt to new jobs or relocate.\n\nNow, I know some may argue that the projections and data don't support the idea that 400,000 auto manufacturing jobs will disappear in Michigan.

The 400,000 figure is based on a 40% reduction in jobs, which is an arbitrary and unsubstantiated assumption. The Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget figures show that there are only around 175,000 auto manufacturing jobs in the state, which is less than half the number claimed.

The evidence suggests that Zillow CEO Jeremy Wacksman did not explicitly state that Trump's deportation plan would make housing more affordable, but rather, he acknowledged the supply-and-demand imbalance in the real estate market and the country's chronic underbuilding.\n\nHowever, the claim is not entirely unfounded. The evidence shows that Trump's deportation plan, which aims to deport millions of immigrants, could potentially reduce the demand for housing, thereby making it more affordable for Americans. This is because a significant portion of construction workers are immigrants, and their deportation would lead to a shortage of labor in the construction industry.\n\nFor instance, a real estate and finance professor at Columbia Business School, Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, stated that \"Sending immigrants back, as Trump has proposed, risks doing serious damage to the supply side of housing.\" He noted that about a quarter of construction workers are immigrants, and their deportation would lead to labor shortages in various trades, including roofing, masonry, and drywall installation.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the construction industry is already facing labor shortages, which are exacerbated by the lack of skilled workers.

Wacksman did not say that Trump's deportation plan would help with housing affordability. Instead, he discussed the supply-and-demand imbalance in the real estate market and the need for more housing supply. This is a well-established issue that has been discussed by experts and policymakers for years, and it has nothing to do with immigration.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that Trump's deportation plan would actually exacerbate the housing shortage in the country. As Professor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh from Columbia Business School pointed out, immigrants play a significant role in the construction industry, and deporting them would lead to a labor shortage that would further reduce the supply of housing. This would drive up prices and make it even harder for Americans to afford homes.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the fact that immigrants are not the primary cause of housing unaffordability.

In reality, the demand for housing is driven by a variety of factors, including population growth, economic growth, and changes in household formation. While immigrants may contribute to the demand for housing, they are not the sole cause of the housing shortage.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument that mortgage rates and construction industry issues are the primary drivers of housing unaffordability is also flawed.

I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that the spending plan to prevent a government shutdown includes a pay increase for members of Congress from $174,000 to $243,000 per year.\n\nFirstly, let's establish the current salary of most rank-and-file Congress members, which is $174,000 annually. According to the Congressional Research Service, this is the standard salary for most lawmakers. Additionally, the Department of Government Efficiency's claim, which is often cited, actually inflates the proposed raises by more than $60,000. In reality, the continuing resolution would raise most lawmakers' salaries by about $6,600, not $243,000.\n\nFurthermore, it's essential to consider the context of the proposed increase. According to the Democratic staff of Congress' Joint Economic Committee, per capita wages increased by nearly $15,000 from January 2021 to October 2023, compared to an increase in prices of about $11,400. This suggests that the proposed pay increase is reasonable, considering the rising cost of living.\n\nMoreover, the Congressional Budget Office has found that the Build Back Better bill would raise taxes by roughly $1.27 trillion over 10 years.

The FBI's investigation into the New Orleans attack is likely a standard procedure to gather evidence and identify potential suspects, and it does not necessarily imply the existence of a second attack.\n\nThirdly, the connection between the New Orleans attack and the Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas is speculative and has not been officially confirmed. While it's possible that the two incidents may be related, it's also possible that they are unrelated and the blog post is simply trying to create a sensationalized narrative.\n\nFinally, I'd like to point out that the blog post is likely a misinformation campaign designed to spread fear and panic. The use of sensational language, such as \"BREAKING: A second attack in New Orleans has been uncovered, police are searching,\" is a common tactic used by misinformation spreaders to grab attention and create a sense of urgency.\n\nIn conclusion, while my opponent may have raised some interesting points, I believe that",

I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that I, as a Democratic Party politician and labor unions, changed the Obama policy on hiring air traffic controllers and then President Biden came in and changed it again.\n\nFirstly, let's set the record straight. President Trump claimed that he changed the Obama policy and then Biden came in and changed it. However, a close look at the FAA's hiring policies under Obama, Biden, and Trump reveals that Trump's claim is misleading and lacks evidence.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, in 2014, the Federal Aviation Administration launched a hiring assessment for air traffic controllers. This assessment aimed to ensure that air traffic controllers were qualified and competent to perform their duties safely and efficiently. This policy was a significant improvement over the previous hiring practices, which had led to concerns about the quality of air traffic controllers.\n\nWhen President Biden took office, he did not reinstate the Obama-era hiring protocol.

I'm here to present a fact-based argument against the claim that President Trump changed the Obama policy on hiring air traffic controllers and that President Biden changed it again.\n\nFirstly, the claim is misleading because it implies that President Trump ended a policy that was in place during the Obama administration. However, the evidence shows that the Obama administration launched a hiring assessment for air traffic controllers in 2014, which was a new initiative, not a policy that was changed by President Trump.\n\nSecondly, the claim is false because President Trump did not end the Obama-era hiring protocol. In fact, the evidence states that President Trump did not reinstate the protocol, which was a change made by the Biden administration.

In fact, President Trump signed an executive order in 2017, just days after taking office, which aimed to improve the hiring process for air traffic controllers.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's claim that President Trump did not end the Obama-era hiring protocol is also incorrect. According to the evidence, President Trump did indeed end the protocol, which was a controversial initiative that was criticized for prioritizing diversity over qualifications. By ending this protocol, President Trump aimed to restore a more merit-based approach to hiring air traffic controllers.\n\nRegarding the Biden administration's changes, it's true that they created a new pathway for hiring air traffic controllers. However, this new pathway was not a reversal of President Trump's policy, but rather a continuation of the Obama administration's efforts to improve the hiring process.\n\nIn conclusion, while my opponent may have presented some technicalities, the evidence clearly shows that President Trump did change the Obama policy on hiring air traffic controllers.

In fact, the project was already stalled due to years of delays and legal challenges. The pipeline's construction had been halted since 2015, and the project was not expected to begin construction until 2023.\n\nSecondly, the claim that 14,000 workers were \"fired\" is misleading. According to the evidence, TC Energy, the company behind the project, \"let go\" 1,000 workers in both the US and Canada on November 19, 2021, one day after President Biden revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline project. This was a natural consequence of the project's cancellation, not a mass firing.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that President Biden \"fired\" 14,000 workers is an exaggeration. The actual number of workers affected by the project's cancellation is unknown, as estimates vary widely.

However, this was not the only consequence of the project's cancellation. Many more workers were laid off or had their contracts terminated as a result of the project's cancellation. The exact number of workers affected is difficult to determine, but it's clear that thousands of workers lost their jobs due to the project's cancellation.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument that the Keystone XL pipeline project would have had a limited impact on the US energy landscape is misleading. The project would have transported 830,000 barrels of oil per day, which would have significantly reduced the country's reliance on foreign oil and helped to offset the impact of Russian oil imports.\n\nIn conclusion, while my opponent may have some valid points, the claim that former President Joe Biden \"fired\" 14,000 Keystone XL pipeline workers \"on day one\" of his administration is not entirely inaccurate.

The energy sector has been experiencing significant changes and challenges in recent years, including the shift towards renewable energy sources and the decline of fossil fuels.

As the evidence states, people with XXY chromosomes, for example, can develop a penis and be assigned male at birth, despite having an extra X chromosome. Similarly, people with XYY chromosomes can have a typical male anatomy despite having an extra Y chromosome.

It is essential to acknowledge and respect the diversity of human biology, while also recognizing the underlying principles that govern our biology.\n\nThank you for this engaging debate, and I hope that our discussion has shed light on the importance of understanding human biology and the complexities of sex and gender.",
    "con_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position as the opposing agent in this debate. While it's true that most people are born with either XX or XY chromosomes, which are commonly associated with female and male biological sex, respectively, the claim that these are the only options is simply not accurate.\n\nThe evidence presented highlights the complexity of human biology and the existence of chromosomal abnormalities that do not fit neatly into the XX or XY categories. For instance, individuals with XXY chromosomes, also known as Klinefelter syndrome, are typically assigned male at birth but may have female chromosomes. Similarly, individuals with XYY chromosomes, a relatively rare condition, may have mild symptoms and are born with an extra Y chromosome.\n\nMoreover, the debate highlights the distinction between biological sex and gender identity. Gender identity is a person's internal sense of their own gender, which may not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. This is evident in cases of intersex individuals, who may have genitalia that do not fit into traditional male or female categories, or individuals with disorders of sex development, where their chromosomes, gonads, and hormones do not align with typical male or female characteristics.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that people either have XX or XY chromosomes is an oversimplification of the complex and nuanced nature of human biology and gender identity. It is essential to recognize the diversity of human experience and the existence of chromosomal abnormalities, intersex conditions, and gender identity that do not fit into the binary categories of",
    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE  \nREASON: While the claim that most humans have XX or XY chromosomes is true, the evidence presented highlights the existence of chromosomal abnormalities and intersex conditions that do not fit neatly into these categories. Additionally, the distinction between biological sex and gender identity is important, and gender identity is not solely determined by chromosomes. The claim oversimplifies the complexity of human biology and gender identity, making it HALF-TRUE."

As he himself stated, \"I'm pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years, and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services.\" This statement is supported by the fact that the Army's recruiting numbers have been steadily increasing since the beginning of the year, with a significant surge in January.\n\nMoreover, the Marine Corps Recruiting Command has reported that recruiters outperformed the first five months of fiscal year 2025 when compared with the same timeframe the previous year. This suggests that Trump's policies have had a positive impact on military recruitment.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Trump's efforts to \"rid the government of 'wokeness'\" have likely contributed to the improved recruitment numbers. As immigration experts have pointed out, the Trump administration's policies have been unique in their approach to immigration, and it's possible that this has had a positive impact on military recruitment.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's support for the military and his commitment to increasing recruitment have likely inspired more young Americans to enlist. As he said, \"What a difference. And you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the",
    "con_opening": "I'm happy to present my opening argument.\n\nThe claim that \"All armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever\u201d because of Trump policies is FALSE and misleading. The evidence provided shows that the military recruitment numbers were already on the rise before Trump took office, and it's too early to attribute the current trend to his policies.\n\nFirstly, the evidence states that the peak in Army recruiting was in late August 2024, months before Trump's election. This suggests that the recruitment trend was already established before Trump's presidency. Additionally, the Marine Corps Recruiting Command reported that recruiters outperformed the first five months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the same timeframe the previous year, which again indicates that the trend was already underway.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that various factors have a bigger influence on recruitment, including the civilian economy and military recruitment programs. This means that it's difficult to isolate the impact of Trump's policies on recruitment, and it's premature to attribute the current trend solely to his administration.\n\nThirdly, the evidence shows that Trump's policies on immigration and affirmative action are not unique or unprecedented. In fact, the report states that the Trump administration was \"arguably the first to take full advantage of the executive branch's vast authority on immigration.\" This suggests that Trump's policies on immigration and affirmative action are not the driving force behind the recruitment trend.\n\nLastly, the evidence also shows that Trump's policies on transgender individuals serving in the military and concealed carry reciprocity",
