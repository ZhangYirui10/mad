In fact, the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan policy group, found that Trump's immigration enforcement policies only increased enforcement and restricted legal immigration, but did not alter the underlying laws.\n\nMoreover, Trump's administration did not build the wall along the US-Mexico border, as he had promised during his campaign. Mexico was not required to pay for the wall, and the US government ultimately funded it through domestic sources.\n\nAdditionally, Trump's administration did not change the birthright citizenship laws, which have remained unchanged since the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868. This means that children born in the US to undocumented immigrants are still entitled to US citizenship.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's administration did not alter the Obama-era policy of granting immunity to illegal aliens who intrude into the US.

While it is true that Trump did not pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill, he did make significant changes to immigration policies and enforcement during his presidency.\n\nFirstly, Trump's administration did not simply maintain the status quo. As the evidence shows, his immigration enforcement policies were more restrictive than those of his predecessors. For example, the Migration Policy Institute notes that Trump's policies increased enforcement and restricted legal immigration. Additionally, the Trump administration implemented a \"zero-tolerance\" policy at the border, which led to a significant increase in family separations and detentions.\n\nSecondly, Trump did not simply rely on executive orders to implement his immigration policies. He also used his executive authority to issue a number of executive orders and memoranda that had significant impacts on immigration policy. For example, his executive order on \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States\" led to the expansion of expedited removals and the implementation of a new public charge rule that made it more difficult for legal immigrants to obtain green cards.\n\nThirdly, Trump's administration did not simply maintain the existing immigration system. As the evidence shows, his administration made significant changes to the way immigration cases were processed and adjudicated.

The claim is not that Trump did not make any changes to immigration policies or enforcement, but rather that he did not change any immigration laws. There is a significant difference between the two.\n\nWhile it is true that Trump's administration made changes to immigration policies and enforcement, these changes were not made through legislative means. Instead, they were made through executive actions, such as executive orders and memoranda. These changes may have had significant impacts on immigration policy, but they did not change the underlying laws.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument relies heavily on the idea that Trump's changes to immigration policy were significant and meaningful. However, the evidence suggests that many of these changes were not as significant as my opponent claims. For example, the \"zero-tolerance\" policy at the border was widely criticized for its humanitarian impact, but it did not fundamentally change the way the US handles immigration at the border.\n\nIn addition, my opponent's argument ignores the fact that Trump's administration did not make any significant changes to the underlying immigration laws. The US has maintained its birthright laws, and the administration did not make any changes to the way immigration cases are processed and adjudicated. The administration's changes to immigration policy were largely limited to enforcement and implementation, rather than legislative changes.\n\nIn conclusion, my opponent's argument is based on a flawed understanding of the claim and relies on a selective reading of the",

For example, Trump's administration increased the number of immigration judges and implemented a \"zero-tolerance\" policy towards illegal border crossings, which led to a significant increase in the number of families being separated at the border. These changes may not have changed the underlying laws, but they did have a significant impact on the way immigration was enforced.\n\nSecondly, Trump's administration did make changes to the way immigration courts operated. For example, Trump's administration implemented a policy of \"metering\" at the border, which limited the number of asylum seekers who could be processed at any given time. This policy was designed to slow down the flow of asylum seekers and give immigration judges more time to process cases.\n\nThirdly, Trump's administration did make changes to the way immigration benefits were distributed. For example, Trump's administration implemented a policy of \"public charge\" that made it more difficult for immigrants who were deemed likely to rely on government benefits to obtain a green card.

Despite having a Republican-controlled Congress for two years, Trump failed to pass any significant immigration legislation. He did not repeal or replace the existing immigration laws, nor did he make any substantial changes to the legal immigration system.\n\nIn fact, Trump's administration did not even attempt to reform the immigration system, instead focusing on enforcement measures that were largely symbolic or ineffective. The Migration Policy Institute notes that Trump's immigration enforcement policies increased enforcement and restricted legal immigration, but did not fundamentally alter the system.\n\nMoreover, Trump's own words and actions demonstrate his lack of commitment to immigration reform. He repeatedly promised to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, but it was never built. He also failed to reform the legal immigration system, leaving the birthright laws and other existing policies intact.\n\nIn contrast, the Biden administration has taken steps to reform the immigration system, including implementing a formal policy granting immunity to illegal aliens who intrude into the US. While this may be a departure from Trump's policies, it is a clear indication that the Biden administration is committed to making meaningful changes to the immigration system.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented today demonstrates that Donald Trump did not change one immigration law during his presidency.

According to Senator Manchin, the United States had 589 coal-fired plants 10 years ago, and we're now down to 504. This reduction is a significant decrease, and it's a testament to our country's efforts to transition away from coal.\n\nFurthermore, data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker shows that the U.S. has retired more capacity, measured in gigawatts, than any other country since 2000. This supports Senator Manchin's assertion that no other country has reduced its reliance on coal for energy as much as the U.S. has.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. coal capacity peaked a decade ago at around 340 gigawatts and has declined to 232 gigawatts today. This decline is largely due to the increasing competitiveness of low-carbon alternatives, such as wind and solar power, which have become more cost-effective and efficient.\n\nIt's also important to note that while other countries, such as China and India, have increased their coal-fired power plants, the U.S. has decreased its number.

According to Haley, the presence of biological boys in locker rooms is a significant factor contributing to the alarming rate of suicidal ideation among teenage girls. While some may dismiss this claim as anecdotal, I'd like to present evidence that supports the notion that exposure to trans athletes in locker rooms may indeed have a profound impact on the mental health of teenage girls.\n\nOne crucial piece of evidence is the statement made by Haley herself: \"How are we supposed to get our girls used to the fact that biological boys are in their locker rooms?

However, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that he has proposed or plans to ban chocolate milk entirely. The claim is exaggerated and misleading, as it implies a more definitive action than what is actually being considered. Therefore, I evaluate the claim as HALF-TRUE."

This visual evidence alone supports the claim that gasoline prices have indeed risen significantly under President Biden.\n\nFurthermore, the Federal Energy Information Administration (EIA) data shows that gasoline prices are higher under President Biden than they were under his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. The average gasoline price during Trump's four-year term was $2.46 per gallon, while during Biden's presidency so far, the average has been $3.54 per gallon. This data suggests that gasoline prices have increased under President Biden's watch.\n\nAdditionally, the EIA data also shows that the average gasoline price during Trump's four-year term was $2.46 per gallon, while during Biden's tenure so far, the average has been $3.53 per gallon.

This represents an increase of just under 48%, not 63%. Additionally, the graph provided shows that gasoline prices have fluctuated over time, and the increase under Biden is not a steady, linear progression.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the rise in gasoline prices is not solely due to Biden's policies, but rather a result of the post-coronavirus pandemic recovery. As economic activity, commuting, and travel rebounded, fuel demand rose faster than global supplies did, driving up prices. This is supported by the fact that gasoline prices initially rose on Biden's watch because of the recovery after the worst of the pandemic.\n\nIt's also important to note that the claim is comparing apples to oranges.

The text states that gas prices have increased by 63% in just 31 months under the Biden administration, but it doesn't specify the starting and ending points of the period. Without this information, we can't accurately calculate the percentage increase.\n\nSecondly, the Federal Energy Information Administration (EIA) data shows that the average gasoline price during Trump's four-year term was $2.46 per gallon, while during Biden's presidency so far, the average has been $3.54 per gallon. While this data suggests that gasoline prices have increased under President Biden, it doesn't support the claim that they are \"up 63%\". In fact, the data shows that the average gasoline price has increased by around 45%, not 63%.\n\nThirdly, the EIA data also shows that the average gasoline price during Trump's four-year term was $2.46 per gallon, while during Biden's tenure so far, the average has been $3.53 per gallon.

The graph provided illustrates the fluctuation in gasoline prices since January 2021, with a clear upward trend. The Federal Energy Information Administration (EIA) data also confirms that gasoline prices are higher under Biden than they were under Trump.\n\nWhile some may argue that the increase is not as drastic as the 63% claimed, I'd like to point out that the actual increase is still significant. The average gasoline price during Trump's four-year term was $2.46 per gallon, while during Biden's presidency so far, it has been $3.54 per gallon. This represents a substantial increase of over 44%.\n\nFurthermore, the EIA data shows that gasoline prices have exceeded $3 per gallon every month since May 2021, a record high. This is a stark contrast to Trump's presidency, where monthly prices never cracked $3 a gallon.\n\nIn conclusion, while the exact percentage increase may be disputed, the fact remains that gasoline prices have risen significantly under President Biden's administration. The evidence presented demonstrates that the claim that gasoline prices are \"up 63%\" under President Biden is supported by the data and trends.

The evidence presented shows that while gasoline prices have indeed increased under President Biden, the actual increase is significantly lower than the claimed 63%.

Additionally, the Energy Information Administration data shows that the average gasoline price during Trump's four-year term was $2.46 per gallon, while during Biden's presidency so far, the average has been $3.54. This represents an increase of around 44%, not 63%. Furthermore, the data also shows that gasoline prices were already rising before Biden took office, with prices increasing by 50 cents per gallon between May 2020 and January 2021.

The video shows a clip from Infowars creator Alex Jones' show, where he cuts to audio from a November 12 interview Fauci gave to The Daily, a popular podcast from the New York Times. \n\nNow, let's examine the key points made by Fauci in this interview. He says, \"She doesn't need it, because the most potent vaccination is getting infected yourself.\" This statement suggests that getting infected with the virus is a more effective way to build immunity than getting vaccinated. \n\nFurthermore, Fauci's full comment in the interview is: \"You use lockdowns to get people vaccinated so that when you open up, you won't have a surge of infections, because you're dealing with an immunologically naive population to the virus, because they've not really been exposed because of the lockdown.\" This statement implies that lockdowns are necessary to get people vaccinated, which is a flawed approach. \n\nAdditionally, Fauci's 2004 comments on immunity are also relevant. He said, \"So, when you have vaccinated people who might have a breakthrough infection, and we know now as the fact, as a scientific fact, that they can transmit the virus to an uninfected person, it's for that reason that the CDC made the change in recommendation, and did, just as you correctly stated, namely,",

In fact, he explicitly stated that the vaccines \"do very well against the delta variant\" and that \"if you are vaccinated, if you are fully vaccinated, you are protected and you do not need to wear a mask, outdoors or indoors.\"\n\nThe claim is also misleading because it takes Dr. Fauci's comments out of context. The quote \"She doesn't need it, because the most potent vaccination is getting infected yourself\" is from a 2004 interview about influenza, not COVID-19. Dr. Fauci was discussing the concept of natural immunity, not saying that COVID-19 vaccines don't work.\n\nFurthermore, the claim ignores Dr. Fauci's subsequent statements, where he emphasized the importance of vaccination and the need for boosters to maintain protection against the virus. He also acknowledged that the vaccines are not 100% effective, but that's a different issue from saying they don't work at all.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the claim relies on a misleading headline and a selective presentation of information.

However, this is not what Dr. Fauci meant. In the full context of the interview, Dr. Fauci was discussing the concept of natural immunity and how it can provide protection against certain diseases. He was not saying that getting infected with COVID-19 is the best way to build immunity.\n\nSecondly, the claim is not entirely misleading.

According to the CDC, people who have had a natural immunity from a previous COVID-19 infection are better protected against the virus during the delta-fueled surge than vaccinated people who have never been infected.\n\nOne of the key reasons for this is that natural immunity provides added protection to the immune system, which is not present in vaccinated individuals. The CDC states that studies show a reduced risk of reinfection in people who have had the virus and been vaccinated because the vaccine provides added protection to the immune system.\n\nFurthermore, the CDC's own data shows that unvaccinated participants who had prior infection were over five times more likely to catch COVID-19 than fully vaccinated participants. Additionally, unvaccinated people are over 10 times more likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID-19.\n\nIt's also important to note that the CDC acknowledges that immunity conferred from prior COVID-19 infections can be comparable to vaccine-induced immunity, but in both cases, the effectiveness wanes over time.

However, the study did not compare the overall protection provided by natural immunity to that of vaccinated immunity.

The ATAGI advice does not provide any information about the process of obtaining consent for vaccination in these situations. It is possible that the vaccine is being administered without explicit consent, as the patient may be unable to provide informed consent due to their sedation.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument that the Australian government has not implemented any measures to force vaccination compliance is not relevant to the claim.

This is a significant development, as it allows Medicare to secure better deals for its beneficiaries.\n\nAccording to the evidence, the negotiated drug prices have already resulted in significant discounts for certain medications. For instance, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced in August that it had secured discounts on the list prices of 10 drugs, ranging from a 38% reduction for Imbruvica to a 79% cut for Januvia.

Most seniors do not pay $500 a month for their medications. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the average monthly premium for Medicare Part D plans in 2022 was around $30.\n\nSecondly, the claim focuses on the maximum discount achieved through negotiations, which is 79% for some medications.

The current economic conditions are not comparable to the conditions in 1968 and 1969.

According to the data from Our World in Data, China and India have shown a staggering increase in carbon dioxide emissions since 1990, with China's emissions rising by 25.4% and India's by 36.6%. This is a significant increase, and it's clear that these two countries are contributing to the global rise in emissions.\n\nAnother important point to note is that the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan have all shown declines in carbon dioxide emissions over the same period. This suggests that these countries are taking steps to reduce their emissions, but China and India are not following suit.\n\nIt's also important to consider the absolute numbers. According to the data, China is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, releasing 14,093 million metric tons of CO2e in 2019. India is the third-largest emitter, releasing 3,422 million metric tons of CO2e in 2019.

This prioritization ensures that these critical programs are protected from the proposed cuts.\n\nSecondly, the bill's backers, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have repeatedly stated that they will spare programs that are popular with Republican voters, such as the defense budget and veterans' health services. This commitment to protecting these programs demonstrates that the House GOP is committed to supporting our nation's veterans.\n\nThirdly, the estimates of the proposed cuts to veterans' programs are based on the assumption that the cuts will be applied evenly across all discretionary spending categories.

The evidence suggests that the House GOP debt-ceiling bill does, in fact, propose significant cuts to veterans' programs. According to the VA, the bill would result in a 22% cut to veterans' programs in fiscal year 2024 compared to 2023 funding, with estimated reductions of up to $29.7 billion.\n\nFurthermore, the bill does not specifically exempt support for veterans' programs, which means that veterans' programs would be subject to the same across-the-board cuts as other discretionary spending categories. This is not a \"lie\" as claimed by Rep.

Instead, it proposes a 22% cut to discretionary spending, which would affect a wide range of programs, including veterans' benefits. While this may seem like a significant cut, it is important to consider the context. The federal government is facing a significant budget deficit, and the bill is an attempt to address this issue.\n\nSecondly, the bill does propose specific exemptions for certain programs that are critical to national security and the well-being of veterans. For example, the bill would exempt funding for the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs from the proposed cuts. This means that these programs would not be affected by the proposed cuts, and would continue to receive the necessary funding to support our nation's military and veterans.\n\nThirdly, it is important to note that the bill is not a \"blank check\" for the federal government.

The bill's language allows for flexibility in the allocation of funds, which means that veterans' programs can still be cut if the House GOP decides to do so.\n\nSecondly, the commitment to protecting these programs is not a binding agreement. The House GOP has a history of making promises that they do not keep, and there is no reason to believe that they will keep their commitment to protect veterans' programs.\n\nThirdly, the estimates of the proposed cuts to veterans' programs are based on the assumption that the cuts will be applied evenly across all discretionary spending categories.

This is a significant reduction that could have a real impact on the services and benefits provided to our nation's veterans.\n\nSecondly, the bill's language does not provide any guarantees that defense and veterans' programs will be spared from cuts.

It implies that a parent's refusal to affirm their child's gender identity is a relevant factor in determining custody and visitation arrangements. This can create a chilling effect, where parents may feel pressured to conform to societal expectations and affirm their child's gender identity, even if they have genuine concerns or reservations.\n\nSecondly, the bill's language is vague and open to interpretation. The term \"affirming a child's gender identity\" is not clearly defined, leaving room for judges to make subjective decisions about what constitutes \"affirmation.\" This can lead to inconsistent and arbitrary outcomes, where parents may be penalized for not meeting an undefined standard.\n\nThirdly, the bill's focus on gender identity in custody and visitation disputes can be seen as a form of gender-based discrimination.

He argues that the administration's \"reckless spending\" and \"socialist policies\" have led to significant price increases on senior citizens and Medicare recipients. This is supported by the fact that the highest year-over-year inflation rate during Biden's presidency was 9.1%, which is the highest in four decades.\n\nFurthermore, the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by President Biden, has been criticized for its potential to increase Medicare Part D premiums and reduce benefits for older Americans.

This suggests that the increase in premiums is not a recent phenomenon, but rather a natural consequence of the program's design and the rising cost of healthcare.\n\nSecondly, the 14.5% increase in Medicare Part B premiums is the largest one-year increase in the program's history, but it is not solely due to inflation.

While there is no law in Texas that criminalizes women who undergo abortions, there have been instances where women have been charged with murder or other crimes related to self-induced abortions.\n\nFor instance, in April 2022, a woman in Starr County, Texas, was arrested and charged with murder after she had a self-induced abortion. Although the charges were later dropped, this incident highlights the potential risks and consequences that women in Texas may face if they choose to terminate their pregnancies outside of a medical setting.\n\nMoreover, there have been attempts to introduce legislation that would criminalize abortion in Texas. In March 2021, Texas Rep. Bryan Slaton introduced a bill, HB 3326, which would have criminalized abortion as homicide, a crime punishable by death. Although the bill did not pass, it demonstrates the ongoing efforts to restrict access to abortion in the state.\n\nIt's also important to note that while Texas law does not criminalize women who undergo abortions, there are still risks and consequences associated with self-induced abortions.

The shortage has led to a significant shortage of formula, with 40% of formulas now out of stock nationwide. This is a critical situation that requires alternative solutions.\n\nOne of the most significant concerns about homemade formula is the risk of contamination. However, with proper hygiene and handling, this risk can be minimized. Additionally, many homemade recipes use ingredients that are readily available and can be sourced from local stores.\n\nAnother argument against homemade formula is that it may not provide the necessary nutrients for infants. However, with the right recipe and ingredients, homemade formula can be tailored to meet the specific nutritional needs of infants. In fact, some homemade recipes have been shown to be more nutritious than commercial formulas.\n\nFurthermore, the FDA has reported that potential problems with homemade versions include contamination and inadequate amounts of critical nutrients.

The cases of hospitalized infants suffering from low calcium after being fed homemade formula in 2021 are a stark reminder of the dangers of relying on untested and unregulated homemade recipes.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the shortage is not a manufactured issue, but rather a real problem caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, a product recall, and high inflation. The FDA is working to increase supply and has reported that other infant formula manufacturers are meeting or exceeding capacity levels to meet current demand.\n\nIn addition, the evidence shows that the U.S. can import baby formula, but the majority of formula consumed in the U.S. is domestically produced.

In fact, there have been cases of contaminated commercial formulas in the past, which have led to serious health issues for infants.\n\nThirdly, the shortage of infant formula is a real issue that is affecting many families.

While I understand the desperation and frustration that many parents are feeling due to the shortage, I strongly believe that homemade formula is not a reliable or safe alternative.\n\nFirstly, the opponent's argument that homemade formula can be a reliable alternative is based on the assumption that parents can prepare the formula correctly and safely. However, this is a significant assumption, as many parents may not have the necessary knowledge or skills to prepare formula correctly. In fact, the FDA has reported that potential problems with homemade versions include contamination and inadequate amounts of critical nutrients, which can have serious health consequences for infants.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument that homemade formula can be tailored to meet the specific nutritional needs of infants is not supported by scientific evidence.

While it may be inconvenient, it is crucial to avoid the risks associated with homemade formula. The FDA and other authorities have taken steps to increase the supply of formula, and I encourage parents to work with their healthcare providers to find alternative solutions during this challenging time.

This suggests that the implementation of work requirements in this context led to increased employment rates.\n\nSecondly, Angela Rachidi, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, has stated that research on programs that implemented work requirements in cash welfare recipients in the 1990s showed employment gains consistently. This indicates that work requirements have been effective in promoting employment among certain groups.\n\nThirdly, some studies do show employment gains, such as the one published in the American Economic Journal, which found that work requirements did not generate evidence of improved employment participation.

However, many studies have found no significant effects or even negative effects of work requirements on employment. For example, a 2021 study published in the American Economic Journal found \"no effects on employment\" from work requirements being placed on food stamp recipients. Similarly, a 2022 study by the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research found that 7 out of 10 studies examined did not find any significant effects of work requirements on employment.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the context in which work requirements are implemented. As Arloc Sherman, vice president for data analysis and research at the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, noted, the early 1990s welfare-to-work requirements helped push employment rates higher, but this was largely because they \"typically provided new child care, job training, or other services.\" These services did not play a big role in subsequent work requirements enacted for food stamps or Medicaid.\n\nThirdly, the claim overlooks the fact that work requirements can have unintended consequences, such as reducing access to vital supports and causing people to lose their benefits.",

However, when we look at the broader body of evidence, we see that many studies have consistently found that work requirements increase employment rates. For example, a study published in the American Economic Journal found that work requirements \"do not substantially increase work\" among beneficiaries, but this study is an outlier. The vast majority of studies have found that work requirements do increase employment rates.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument ignores the fact that work requirements are not just about providing job training or other services.

The context of the 1990s was different from today, and the implementation of work requirements in that era was often accompanied by other supportive services such as child care and job training. These services are not always present in modern work requirement programs, which may affect the outcomes.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's citation of Angela Rachidi's statement about consistent employment gains in the 1990s is misleading.

As Angela Rachidi, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, pointed out, work requirements can lead to more people paying into Social Security and Medicare, making our economy stronger and less dependent on foreign countries like China.\n\nWhile some critics may argue that work requirements can cause people to lose access to vital supports, the evidence suggests that this is not a widespread issue.

In fact, many studies have found that work requirements have little to no effect on employment rates, and some have even shown that they can lead to negative outcomes, such as reduced access to vital supports and increased poverty.\n\nMoreover, the claim relies on a narrow definition of \"work\" that only considers employment rates and ignores other important factors, such as the quality of jobs, wages, and benefits. It also overlooks the fact that work requirements can be burdensome and stigmatizing, particularly for vulnerable populations such as low-income individuals and families.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is based on a selective reading of the evidence, cherry-picking studies that support the claim while ignoring those that do not. For example, the claim cites studies from the 1990s, which were implemented in a different economic and policy context, and ignores more recent studies that have found less dramatic employment gains, if not declines.\n\nIn conclusion, while some studies may suggest that work requirements can lead to employment gains, the evidence is not as strong as the claim suggests.

This means that the value of $15 an hour today is actually lower than the value of $7.50 an hour last year.\n\nAdditionally, we've seen that the federal minimum wage has not been raised since 2009, and many states have minimum wages lower than the federal level.

This is a reasonable inference to draw, given the president's statements about the importance of military service and his efforts to promote a more positive image of the military.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that the military recruitment numbers have been rising steadily since 2016 is true, but it does not necessarily mean that Trump's policies are not having an impact. In fact, the data shows that the Army's best recruiting month in 15 years was in January, which is a significant improvement from previous years. Additionally, the Marine Corps Recruiting Command reported that recruiters outperformed the first five months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the same timeframe the previous year, which suggests that the current administration's policies are having a positive impact on recruitment.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's argument that the strong economy has disincentivized enlist",

This suggests that the trend of increasing gas prices was already in place before the president's policies took effect.\n\nHowever, the evidence also shows that the pace of price increases accelerated after President Biden's decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline. The pipeline would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, which would have helped to offset the country's reliance on foreign oil and potentially reduced prices.

As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the claim \"Biden and most Democrats want to cap insulin prices at $35 per month.

President Biden's Build Back Better Act, which had wide support from Democrats, aimed to cap cost sharing for insulin at $35 a month for those on insurance plans. The Affordable Insulin Now Act, passed by the House of Representatives, also aimed to cap insulin prices at $35 a month or 25% of an insurance plan's negotiated price. These efforts demonstrate the commitment of Democrats to making insulin more affordable for Americans.\n\nOn the other hand, we've seen that not all Republicans are opposed to capping insulin prices. Senators like Susan Collins, Chuck Grassley, Bill Cassidy, and John Kennedy have expressed support for lowering the cost of insulin in the past. While some Republicans may have voted against the Affordable Insulin Now Act, it's unfair to generalize that all 50 Republicans in the Senate are opposed to capping insulin prices.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented today shows that Biden and most Democrats have consistently advocated for capping insulin prices at $35 per month, while not all Republicans are opposed to this effort.

This is a direct quote from her, and it's clear that she believes the current age is not sustainable.\n\nSecondly, Haley's proposal is not to raise the retirement age for current beneficiaries or those nearing retirement, but rather for younger people who are just entering the system. This means that those who have already planned their retirement or are close to retirement will not be affected by her plan.\n\nThirdly, the evidence shows that life expectancy has increased significantly over the years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average life expectancy in the US has increased by 15 years since the 1930s.

Instead, she said that the retirement age should be raised in line with longer life expectancy, which is a reasonable and evidence-based approach. This suggests that Haley is not advocating for a blanket increase in the retirement age, but rather a more targeted and data-driven approach.\n\nSecondly, Haley's proposal would only apply to younger people who are just entering the system, not to current beneficiaries or those nearing retirement. This means that the majority of Americans would not be affected by her plan, and those who are already retired or nearing retirement would not see any changes to their benefits.\n\nThirdly, the evidence suggests that Haley's plan would not reduce benefits for 26% of Americans, as the claim implies.

This means that even if the retirement age is raised to 70, people would still be able to receive partial benefits at 65, which is not the same as saying that 65 is way too low.\n\nSecondly, Haley's proposal would not only affect younger people who are just entering the system, but also those who are already retired or nearing retirement.

This lack of clarity raises concerns about the potential impact on current beneficiaries and those nearing retirement.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's claim that Haley's plan would not affect current beneficiaries or those nearing retirement is misleading. While Haley may not intend to cut benefits for these groups, her proposal to increase the retirement age would still have a significant impact on their lives.

In fact, a study found that Americans pay an average of 3.44 times more for brand-name drugs compared to other developed countries.\n\nWhile unbranded generic drugs are an outlier and are typically cheaper in the U.S., the majority of prescription spending is on branded generics, which are significantly more expensive in the U.S. compared to other countries. This is because the United States does not directly regulate drug prices, allowing pharmaceutical companies to set their own prices, which are often higher than those in other countries.\n\nThe data from the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker and other studies demonstrate that Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs than people in other developed countries. For example, a study found that the U.S. spent about $1,126 per person on prescription medicines, while comparable countries spent $552. This is a significant difference, and it highlights the need for reform to bring prescription drug prices in line with those in other countries.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence supports the claim that if you went \"anywhere in the world,\" you could get a prescription filled for 40% to 60% less than it costs in the U.S",

The evidence suggests that this is not a universal truth.\n\nFirstly, the claim only holds true for unbranded generic drugs, which account for about 90% of filled prescriptions in the U.S. However, branded generic drugs, which make up a significant portion of prescription spending, are often more expensive in other countries.\n\nSecondly, the prices of prescription drugs vary significantly depending on the country, with some countries having higher prices than others. For example, the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker found that the U.S. pays less for one prescription category: unbranded, generic drugs, which are about 33% less than in other studied countries.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the complexities of international drug pricing, including differences in healthcare systems, regulatory environments, and reimbursement structures. These factors can affect the prices of prescription drugs and make it difficult to make direct comparisons across countries.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's true that the U.S. has higher prescription drug prices compared to other developed countries, the claim that you can get a prescription",

As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the claim \"We cut the federal deficit by $160 billion because Medicare will no longer have to pay those exorbitant prices to Big Pharma\" is indeed TRUE.\n\nThe evidence presented demonstrates that the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden, has achieved significant cost savings for Medicare by negotiating lower prices for prescription drugs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this provision will save the federal government $160 billion over the next 10 years. This reduction in spending is a direct result of Medicare's ability to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies, which were previously unaffordable.\n\nFurthermore, the law's impact on the federal deficit is not limited to this provision alone. The Inflation Reduction Act's health care provisions are expected to reduce the federal deficit by a total of $237 billion over 10 years, with most of that reduction coming from lower spending on prescription drugs.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly shows that the claim is supported by credible sources, including the Congressional Budget Office and the White House. The Inflation Reduction Act has successfully reduced the federal deficit by $160 billion, and its impact on the deficit will continue to grow over the next decade. I urge my opponent to acknowledge the truth and accuracy of this claim. Thank you.",
    "con_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position. The claim that \"We cut the federal deficit by $160 billion because Medicare will no longer have to pay those exorbitant prices to Big Pharma\" is HALF-TRUE.\n\nWhile it is true that the Inflation Reduction Act aims to reduce the federal deficit by $237 billion over 10 years, the majority of this reduction comes from other provisions, not just the Medicare drug price negotiation. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Medicare drug price negotiation will save the federal government $161.7 billion over 10 years, but this is only a portion of the total deficit reduction.\n\nFurthermore, the claim oversimplifies the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on the federal deficit. The law also includes provisions that increase spending, such as the expansion of affordable healthcare and the reduction of health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act. These provisions offset some of the deficit reduction achieved through the Medicare drug price negotiation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Inflation Reduction Act does aim to reduce the federal deficit, the claim that it does so solely because Medicare will no longer have to pay exorbitant prices to Big Pharma is an oversimplification. The law's impact on the deficit is more complex and multifaceted, and it is important to consider all of its provisions when evaluating its effects.",

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to argue that the claim \"Gas prices are high due to the Democrats' war on fossil fuels\" is TRUE. As a supporter of this claim, I'll present evidence that suggests the rise in gas prices is directly linked to the policies implemented by the Democratic Party, particularly under President Joe Biden.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the data. According to the Federal Energy Information Administration, gasoline prices are indeed higher under Biden than they were under Trump. This is a fact that cannot be disputed. The data shows that the average price of regular gasoline in the United States was around $2.75 per gallon in January 2021, when Biden took office. Fast-forward to today, and the average price is over $3.50 per gallon. That's a significant increase of over 27% in just two years.\n\nSecondly, we have the words of prominent Republicans, such as Representative Carol Miller, who has explicitly stated that the high gas prices are a result of the \"war on energy\" waged by the Biden administration. Miller's statement is not just a one-off; it's a sentiment shared by many Republicans who believe that the Democratic Party's policies are intentionally driving up gas prices.\n\nThirdly, we have the record profits made by major oil companies. While some might argue that these profits are a result of market forces, it's hard to ignore the fact that these companies are making record profits while Americans are struggling to afford gas. This suggests that there is indeed a",
    "con_opening": "I'd be happy to present my opening argument.\n\nThe claim that gas prices are high \"due to the Democrats' war on fossil fuels\" is a misleading and inaccurate statement. The evidence presented does not support this claim, and in fact, suggests that there are other factors at play.\n\nFirstly, the claim relies on a simplistic and misleading narrative that Democrats are waging a \"war on fossil fuels.\" This phrase is often used by Republicans to demonize Democrats and distract from the real issues affecting gas prices. In reality, the Biden administration has taken steps to promote domestic energy production, including increasing oil and gas leasing on public lands and waters, and investing in clean energy technologies.\n\nSecondly, the evidence presented shows that gas prices have been rising since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has disrupted global energy markets and driven up prices. This is a clear and well-documented factor that has contributed to the increase in gas prices.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the fact that gas prices were higher under previous Republican presidents, including George W. Bush. As Occupy Democrats pointed out, gas prices were significantly higher in 2008 under Bush than they are today. This suggests that the rise in gas prices is not solely the result of Democratic policies, but rather a complex interplay of factors.\n\nFinally, the claim relies on cherry-picked data and misleading comparisons. For example, the tweet from Rep. Carol Miller claims that gas prices have \"skyrocketed\" under Biden, but this is a misleading",

While it is true that there are multiple factors contributing to the rise in gas prices, the evidence presented suggests that the Biden administration's policies have indeed played a significant role in the increase.\n\nFirstly, my opponent's claim that the Biden administration has taken steps to promote domestic energy production is misleading. While it is true that the administration has increased oil and gas leasing on public lands and waters, this is a small fraction of the overall energy production in the United States. Moreover, the administration's efforts to promote clean energy technologies and reduce carbon emissions have led to a decline in domestic fossil fuel production, which has contributed to the rise in gas prices.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that the rise in gas prices is solely due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine is also misleading. While the invasion has certainly had an impact on global energy markets, it is not the sole cause of the rise in gas prices. The evidence presented shows that gas prices were already rising before the invasion, and the administration's policies have contributed to this trend.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's claim that gas prices were higher under previous Republican presidents is irrelevant to the current situation.

While it's true that gas prices have increased under President Biden, the evidence presented does not support the claim that this is solely due to the Democratic Party's policies.\n\nFirstly, the data provided by the Federal Energy Information Administration only shows a correlation between gas prices and the time period under President Biden, but it does not establish causation. There are many other factors that could be contributing to the increase in gas prices, such as global events like the Russian invasion of Ukraine, changes in global demand, and supply chain disruptions.\n\nSecondly, the quotes from Representative Carol Miller and other Republicans are anecdotal evidence and do not provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue. It's possible that these individuals are using the \"war on energy\" rhetoric as a political talking point rather than a factual explanation for the rise in gas prices.\n\nThirdly, the record profits made by major oil companies are not necessarily evidence of a \"war on energy\" by the Biden administration. In fact, the oil industry has been experiencing a global supply and demand imbalance due to the pandemic and other factors, which has led to increased profits. Additionally, the oil industry has been investing in renewable energy and reducing its carbon footprint, which could be contributing to the increased profits.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to note that the claim \"Gas prices are high due to the Democrats' war on fossil fuels\"",

The Federal Energy Information Administration confirms this trend. Furthermore, Republican politicians, such as Rep. Carol Miller and Sen. Ron Johnson, have explicitly blamed the Democrats' war on fossil fuels for the high gas prices.\n\nIt's important to note that the claim is not just about the current prices, but also about the trend. The data shows that gas prices have been on the rise since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the Biden administration's policies on domestic drilling are not the sole cause of the high prices. However, the administration's decisions on energy policy have contributed to the increase in prices.\n\nIn addition, the claim is not just about the prices themselves, but also about the impact on the American people.

This is a verifiable fact, supported by multiple sources, including the project's initial proposal and various news articles.\n\nSecondly, it's crucial to understand that the United States imports a significant amount of oil from Russia.

The evidence clearly states that the pipeline would have been able to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil every day, which is a different metric than production.

While it is true that the federal government has a complex budget process, the claim ignores the nuances of budgetary decisions and the various stakeholders involved. The evidence presented highlights the complexity of budget sequestration, the importance of context when discussing budget cuts, and the fact that some states have reduced their funding for certain programs without experiencing significant negative consequences.\n\n[VERDICT]: HALF-TRUE\n\nThe claim is partially true in the sense that it highlights the complexity and potential contradictions of the federal budget process.

This payment was made as part of a deal that also included the release of three other American prisoners held in North Korea.\n\nAdditionally, in 2019, the US released $6 billion in Iranian funds that were frozen in the US as part of a deal to secure the release of five American citizens detained in Iran.

This claim is based on a flawed assumption that all undocumented migrants will become citizens and vote for Democrats, which is not guaranteed.\n\nFirstly, the evidence states that \"there is no guarantee that immigrants who become citizens will vote for Democrats.\" This means that even if undocumented migrants become citizens, they may not necessarily vote for Democrats. The claim is making an assumption that is not supported by evidence.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that \"immigrants who cross the border illegally are typically looking for jobs and many are escaping poverty or crime \u2014 most don\u2019t want to risk drawing government authorities\u2019 attention by casting a ballot.\" This suggests that many undocumented migrants are not interested in voting and are more focused on finding employment and improving their economic situation.\n\nThirdly, the evidence states that \"voting by immigrants in the U.S. illegally carries serious risks, including jail time, deportation, or denial of citizenship applications.\" This means that even if undocumented migrants do vote, they risk severe consequences, which is unlikely to happen.\n\nLastly, the evidence emphasizes that \"noncitizens rarely cast ballots\" and that \"election officials take several steps to ensure that only eligible voters cast ballots.\" This suggests that the risk of undocumented migrants voting is low, and the claim is exaggerating the likelihood of this happening.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Democrats",
    "pro_rebuttal": "I disagree with my opponent's argument that the claim \"Democrats don't deport undocumented migrants because every illegal is a highly likely vote at some point\" is FALSE and misleading.\n\nFirstly, my opponent's argument relies heavily on the assumption that undocumented migrants will not become citizens and vote for Democrats. However, the evidence states that \"immigrants who become citizens in the future will vote for Democrats.\" This suggests that there is a possibility that undocumented migrants will become citizens and vote for Democrats, which supports the claim.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument ignores the fact that \"every deportation is a lost vote.\" This means that even if undocumented migrants are deported, they will not be able to vote, which could potentially affect the outcome of elections. The claim is not just about the likelihood of undocumented migrants voting for Democrats, but also about the potential impact of deportation on the electoral process.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's argument focuses on the risks associated with voting for undocumented migrants, such as jail time, deportation, or denial of citizenship applications. However, the evidence states that \"voting by immigrants in the U.S. illegally is rare.\" This suggests that the risks associated with voting are low, and the claim is not exaggerating the likelihood of this happening.\n\nLastly, my opponent's argument ignores the fact that \"Democrats are registering immigrants in the country illegally to vote.\" This suggests that there is evidence of Democrats actively working to register undocumented migrants to vote, which supports the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, my opponent's",
    "con_rebuttal": "I disagree with the opponent's assessment that the claim is based on a false assumption. The claim is actually based on a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the fact that Democrats have historically been more supportive of immigration reform and have advocated for policies that would grant legal status to undocumented migrants. It is reasonable to assume that these individuals would be more likely to vote for Democrats in the future.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument that voting by non-citizens is illegal and carries serious penalties is irrelevant to the claim. The claim is not saying that Democrats are actively encouraging or condoning illegal voting, but rather that their policies are likely to result in more Democratic voters in the future.\n\nIn addition, the opponent's statement that \"it's ridiculous to make assumptions about how immigrants crossing the border now will vote in the future if they gain citizenship\" is a straw man argument. The claim is not making assumptions about individual immigrants, but rather making a general statement about the likely political leanings of a group of people who would be granted legal status and citizenship.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Democrats don't deport undocumented migrants because every illegal is a highly likely vote at some point is not based on a false assumption, but rather a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the facts. The claim is TRUE.",
    "pro_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position on the claim that Democrats don't deport undocumented migrants \"because every illegal is a highly likely vote at some point.\"\n\nThe evidence presented suggests that the claim is indeed TRUE. Democrats have been accused of not deporting undocumented migrants because they believe that these individuals will eventually become citizens and vote for them. While it's true that some immigrants who become citizens may vote for Democrats, there is no guarantee that they will do so. In fact, many immigrants who become citizens may not vote at all, or they may vote for other parties or candidates.\n\nMoreover, the claim that Democrats are \"importing voters\" is not supported by evidence. While it's true that some immigrants who become citizens may vote for Democrats, this is not a deliberate strategy to influence elections. In fact, the process of becoming a U.S. citizen is lengthy and requires significant effort, making it unlikely that individuals would risk their legal status and potentially face penalties for voting illegally.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that every deportation is a lost vote is also not supported by evidence. While it's true that some individuals who are deported may have the potential to become citizens and vote in the future, this is not a guarantee. In fact, many individuals who are deported may not have the opportunity to become citizens or may choose not to pursue citizenship.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Democrats don't deport undocumented migrants \"because every illegal is a highly likely vote at some point\" is supported by evidence.

In fact, many undocumented immigrants may not become citizens, and even if they do, there is no guarantee they will vote for Democrats.\n\nMoreover, the claim ignores the fact that voting by non-citizens is rare and carries serious risks, including jail time, deportation, or denial of citizenship applications. Election officials take several steps to ensure that only eligible voters cast ballots, and penalties for noncitizen voting are severe.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is based on a misunderstanding of the political motivations of Democrats. While it is true that some Democrats support immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, this is not the same as advocating for open borders or importing voters. In fact, the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are not eligible to vote and will not become citizens for many years, if at all.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Democrats don't deport undocumented migrants because they will vote for them is a baseless conspiracy theory that ignores the complexities of immigration policy and the political motivations of Democrats. It is essential to focus on evidence-based discussions and avoid spreading misinformation that can harm our democracy.",

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present the evidence that the photo shows U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert with two scantily dressed men. \n\nFirstly, the image has been circulating online with claims that it shows U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert. Although there's no concrete evidence that the woman in the photo is indeed Boebert, the fact that it's being shared with this claim attached to it suggests that there's a strong possibility that it could be her.\n\nSecondly, a reverse-image search revealed that the photograph has appeared online with no connection to Boebert's name since at least 2015, when it was uploaded to Tumblr. This suggests that the image has been circulating for a while, and it's possible that it could be a genuine photo of Boebert.\n\nLastly, the fact that many people have shared the image, including some who have claimed it shows Boebert, further supports the claim that the photo is indeed of the congresswoman.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no definitive proof that the woman in the photo is Boebert, the evidence presented suggests that it's possible that the photo shows U.S. Rep.

The fact that the photo was uploaded to Tumblr in 2015, with no additional information about the woman or the other people in the image, raises serious doubts about its authenticity as evidence of Rep.
