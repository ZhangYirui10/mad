    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present the opening argument in support of the claim that \"Gas prices were WAY higher in 2008, under REPUBLICAN president George W. Bush.\"\n\nFirstly, let's look at the evidence provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). According to the EIA, the highest gas prices in the past 20 years occurred in July 2008, during the Bush administration. This is a fact that cannot be disputed.\n\nFurthermore, the statistics show that the average price of oil set by OPEC countries in 2001 was around $23 a barrel. This low price led to increased consumption, and global demand began to rise during Bush's second term. As Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, stated, \"People became so accustomed to low energy that they made long-term decisions based on that. People were driving big cars, people were living hours away from (work) in some cases.\"\n\nThis increase in demand, combined with supply disruptions in Nigeria and Brazil, led to a spike in oil prices past $147 a barrel in the middle of 2008. As a result, gas prices hit their peak above $4 a gallon.\n\nIn contrast, during the Biden administration, gas prices have fluctuated, but they are currently around $3.32 a gallon, which is still well off the peak of about $4.11 in July 2008.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly shows that gas prices were",
    "con_opening": "I disagree with the claim that \"Gas prices were WAY higher in 2008, under REPUBLICAN president George W. Bush.\" The claim is misleading because it cherry-picks a single data point, the highest gas price in 2008, without providing context about the overall trend and other factors that influenced gas prices during the Bush administration.\n\nFirstly, the claim ignores the fact that gas prices were not consistently high throughout the Bush administration. As the evidence shows, gas prices were actually lower during the post-9/11 economic slowdown and the 2008 Wall Street crash and financial crisis. This suggests that the price of gasoline is not solely determined by the president or party in power, but rather by the state of the economy and the balance of supply and demand.\n\nSecondly, the claim fails to consider the impact of global supply and demand on gas prices. The evidence highlights that OPEC's control over oil production and global demand for oil are significant factors in determining gas prices. In 2001, OPEC's low oil prices incentivized increased consumption, leading to rising demand and higher gas prices. Similarly, the 2008 financial crisis led to a decrease in demand and lower gas prices.\n\nLastly, the claim ignores the fact that gas prices have fluctuated within and across administrations, with little correlation to which president or party is in power. The evidence shows that gas prices have been influenced by various factors, including economic shocks, global supply and demand, and OPEC's policy decisions",

The claim is not saying that gas prices were consistently high throughout the Bush administration, but rather that they were higher in 2008 compared to other years.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument that the price of gasoline is not solely determined by the president or party in power is true, but it does not mean that the president has no influence on gas prices. The evidence shows that the health of the economy, global supply and demand, and OPEC's policy decisions all play a role in determining gas prices. However, the claim is not saying that the president is the sole cause of high gas prices, but rather that gas prices were higher in 2008 under the Bush administration.\n\nIn conclusion, my opponent's argument that the claim is misleading is unfounded.

While it is true that the highest gas prices in the past 20 years occurred in July 2008, the opponent's argument oversimplifies the complex factors that contributed to those prices.\n\nFirstly, the opponent's reliance on the EIA statistics is misleading. The EIA data shows that gas prices have fluctuated significantly over the past 20 years, with both Republican and Democratic administrations. The peak price of $4.11 in July 2008 was an anomaly, and it is not representative of the overall trend.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument ignores the significant economic shocks that occurred during the Bush administration, including the 9/11 attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. These events had a profound impact on the global economy and the demand for oil, leading to a significant decrease in gas prices. In fact, by the end of Bush's second term, gas prices had fallen to around $1.83 per gallon.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument fails to consider the role of OPEC in setting oil prices. As Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, noted, OPEC tries to control the price of oil by adjusting production levels. In 2001, OPEC set the average price of oil at around $23 a barrel, which led to increased consumption and rising demand. However, this was not",

As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the claim \"Gas prices were WAY higher in 2008, under REPUBLICAN president George W.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration statistics confirm this fact. While it's true that gas prices have fluctuated over the years, the data demonstrates that the Bush administration experienced both the highest and lowest prices of the past two decades.\n\nIt's crucial to acknowledge that the economy and global supply and demand play a significant role in determining gas prices. The 9/11 attacks and the 2008 financial crisis had a significant impact on the economy, leading to fluctuations in gas prices. However, the data shows that the Bush administration experienced both the peak and trough of gas prices, making it a critical period in understanding the dynamics of the market.\n\nI'd like to emphasize that the claim is not about blaming the president for the price of gas, but rather about providing context and accuracy to the current debate. By acknowledging the historical context, we can better understand the complexities of the market and make informed decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence supports the claim that gas prices were indeed higher in 2008 under President George W.

The statement ignores the significant economic shocks that occurred during Bush's term, including the 9/11 attacks and the 2008 financial crisis, which had a profound impact on the global economy and gas prices.\n\nMoreover, the claim fails to provide context about the fluctuations in gas prices during the Bush administration. As the statistics from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show, gas prices were not consistently high throughout his term. In fact, some of the lowest prices of the past 20 years occurred during the Bush administration.\n\nThe claim also neglects to mention the role of global supply and demand, as well as the actions of OPEC, in determining gas prices. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) plays a significant role in controlling the global supply of oil, and their decisions can have a direct impact on gas prices.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that gas prices were higher in 2008, the claim that \"Gas prices were WAY higher in 2008, under REPUBLICAN president George W.

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present the argument that Cargo ships \"can't get into port\" because of Donald Trump's executive order 13959.\n\nFirstly, let's establish that Executive Order 13959, titled \"Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies\", was signed by President Trump on November 12, 2020. This order prohibited Americans from investing in a group of Chinese companies that the US government claims supply and support China's military, intelligence, and security services.\n\nNow, some may argue that this order does not directly affect cargo ships or the supply chain. However, I'd like to highlight that the order's impact is not limited to investments alone. The order's broader implications can be seen in the global supply chain, particularly in the shipping industry.\n\nThe evidence suggests that the order has led to a significant disruption in the global supply chain, causing cargo ships to be stranded at US ports, unable to unload their cargo. This is not a coincidence. The order's restrictions on Chinese companies have created a ripple effect, affecting the entire supply chain, including cargo ships.\n\nFurthermore, the order's language is clear: it prohibits Americans from investing in companies that support China's military, intelligence, and security services. This means that any company that does business with these Chinese companies is indirectly supporting the Chinese government's military and security efforts. This has led to a significant reduction in trade and commerce between the US and China, resulting in the backlog of cargo ships at US",

The evidence provided shows that the order, titled \"Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies,\" does not prohibit goods from China or other countries from being brought to the U.S. In fact, the order specifically targets American investments in Chinese companies that support China's military, intelligence, and security services, not the importation of goods.\n\nFurthermore, the order does not mention election interference, which is a crucial aspect of the claim. The claim relies on a false narrative that the order is related to election interference, which is not supported by the evidence. The order's purpose is to address national security concerns, not to restrict trade or cause supply chain disruptions.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence shows that the order was signed on November 12, 2020, and the supply chain backlog at U.S. ports is a more recent issue. It is unlikely that the order, which was implemented over a year ago, is the sole cause of the current supply chain issues.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that cargo ships \"can't get into port\" because of Donald Trump's executive order 13959 is FALSE and misleading. The order does not restrict the importation of goods, and its purpose is unrelated to election interference. The claim relies on a false narrative and is not supported by the evidence.",

While it is true that the order does not directly prohibit the importation of goods, it is important to consider the broader context and potential indirect effects of the order on the supply chain.\n\nFirstly, the order's purpose is to address national security concerns by restricting American investments in Chinese companies that support China's military, intelligence, and security services. While this may not directly impact the importation of goods, it can have a ripple effect on the supply chain. For example, if American companies are no longer able to invest in these Chinese companies, it may lead to a reduction in trade and commerce between the two countries, which could contribute to supply chain disruptions.\n\nSecondly, the order's implementation may have led to a decrease in trade and commerce between the two countries, which could also contribute to supply chain disruptions. The order's restrictions on American investments in Chinese companies may have led to a decrease in the flow of goods and services between the two countries, which could have a cascading effect on the global supply chain.\n\nThirdly, the order's impact on the supply chain may be indirect, but it is not impossible.

The government is borrowing to spend because it's not raising enough in taxes, and raising the debt ceiling is an indication to countries and individuals that the government intends to pay its debts back.\n\nMoreover, raising the debt ceiling alone does not authorize new spending. New spending proposals must go through Congress, and raising the debt ceiling only allows for spending on programs that have already been authorized. This means that Democrats are not asking for a blank check to spend as they please, but rather, they are seeking to continue funding programs that have already been approved.\n\nIn",

The evidence presented shows that the debt ceiling is not a blank check for spending, but rather a limit on how much the government can spend before needing authorization to spend again. Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize new spending, but rather allows the government to pay back debts it has already incurred. Additionally, new spending proposals must still go through Congress, and the government is borrowing to spend because it is not raising enough in taxes.\n\nFurthermore, the notion that increasing the debt ceiling creates a \"blank check\" for spending is a common misconception. In reality, the debt ceiling is an indication to countries and individuals that the government intends to pay its debts back. It is not a blank check for Democrats to spend as much as they want without worrying about the repercussions.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Democrats are asking for a blank check book to spend as much as they want without worrying about the repercussions is a misrepresentation of the facts.

    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Democrats are asking for a blank check book to spend as much as they want without worrying about the repercussions\" is partially accurate. While it is true that raising the debt ceiling does not authorize new spending, it does allow the government to continue spending on programs that have already been authorized, and the government is borrowing to spend because it is not raising enough in taxes. However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that Democrats are seeking to spend as much as they want without any accountability or oversight, which is not entirely accurate. The government is still subject to the same budgetary process and must go through Congress to approve new spending proposals. Additionally, the debt ceiling is not a blank check for spending, but rather a limit on how much the government can spend before needing authorization to spend again. Overall, the claim is half-true because it contains some accurate information, but also misrepresents the facts and implies a level of reckless spending that is not supported by the evidence."

According to the evidence, the number of employed Americans rose from 142.7 million to 147.6 million between January 2021 and September, resulting in a gain of nearly 5 million jobs. This is a significant increase, and it's essential to recognize that this growth is not limited to a specific sector or industry.\n\nOne of the most critical points to highlight is that this job growth is unprecedented in American history. The evidence shows that the number of jobs created under President Biden's administration surpasses the job gains of every post-World War II president who first came to office in an election. This is a remarkable achievement, and it's essential to acknowledge the impact it has on the economy and the lives of American workers.\n\nAnother important aspect to consider is the comparison to previous presidents. While some may argue that the total number of jobs created is not the most accurate metric, it's essential to recognize that the U.S. population has grown, and so has the labor force.

By this metric, President Carter actually outperforms President Biden, with job gains of 3.5% compared to Biden's 3.4%.\n\nFurthermore, the claim ignores the fact that the U.S. economy is still about 5 million jobs below the pre-pandemic peak.

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that \"The nation reported adding 194,000 jobs in September, and Florida accounted for 84,500.\"\n\nFirstly, I'd like to acknowledge that the claim is based on the official job numbers released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). According to the BLS, the nation did indeed report adding 194,000 jobs in September. This is a verifiable fact that can be found in the BLS's official report.\n\nSecondly, the claim also states that Florida accounted for 84,500 of those jobs. This figure is also supported by the BLS data. According to the report, Florida's net job gain in September was 84,500, which is a significant contribution to the national total.\n\nIt's worth noting that Florida's job growth in September was not only impressive in terms of raw numbers but also in terms of percentage growth. As the article states, Florida's percentage job growth ranked eighth among the 50 states over the past year, which suggests that the state's economy is performing well.\n\nWhile some may argue that the comparison between the national and state numbers is not entirely apples-to-apples, I believe that the evidence supports the claim that Florida did indeed account for a significant portion of the nation's job growth in September. The BLS data provides a clear and accurate picture of the job market, and it's reasonable to conclude that Florida's job growth was a notable contributor to",
    "con_opening": "I disagree with the claim that \"The nation reported adding 194,000 jobs in September, and Florida accounted for 84,500.\" This claim is misleading because it implies that Florida's job growth is directly comparable to the national job growth, which is not the case.\n\nFirstly, the numbers are calculated differently. The national number of 194,000 jobs added is a raw number, whereas Florida's 84,500 is a percentage of the national total. This makes it difficult to directly compare the two figures.\n\nSecondly, the claim implies that Florida's job growth is responsible for almost half of the nation's job growth, which is an exaggeration. While Florida did have a significant job growth, it is not accurate to attribute it to almost half of the nation's job growth.\n\nThirdly, the claim does not take into account the margin of error in the numbers. The numbers are subject to revision, and the margin of error for individual states is larger than for the national numbers. This means that the actual number of jobs added in Florida could be different from the reported 84,500.\n\nFinally, the claim does not provide context for the job growth. The article mentions that Florida's job growth was affected by the pandemic, and that the state's bounceback in September may have been due to the lower job growth the previous month. This suggests that the job growth in Florida was not necessarily a result of the state's economic policies, but rather a response to external factors.",

The fact that Florida accounted for 84,500 of the 194,000 jobs added is a notable achievement, and it is reasonable to highlight this in the context of the national job growth.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that the claim exaggerates Florida's contribution to the nation's job growth is unfounded.

While it is true that the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported a net gain of 194,000 jobs in September, the claim that Florida accounted for 84,500 of those jobs is an exaggeration.\n\nFirstly, the BLS calculates job numbers differently for the nation and individual states. The national number represents the total change in nonfarm payroll employment, while the state numbers are based on a sample of employers and are subject to a larger margin of error. This means that the state numbers are not directly comparable to the national number, and it's unfair to make a direct comparison.\n\nSecondly, the claim that Florida accounted for 84,500 of the nation's job growth is based on a preliminary estimate that is subject to revision. As the article states, the BLS numbers are subject to revision, and the eventual revisions could make \"significant\" changes to the 84,500 figure. This means that the claim is not based on a reliable or accurate number.\n\nThirdly, the article highlights that Florida's job growth in September was impressive, but it's not as impressive as the claim suggests. While Florida ranked second in the nation in terms of raw job gains, it's important to consider the state's population size. Florida is the third most populous state, which means that its job",
    "pro_closing": "Thank you, esteemed judges, and honorable opponents. As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the claim \"The nation reported adding 194,000 jobs in September, and Florida accounted for 84,500\" is indeed TRUE.\n\nFlorida's job growth in September was a remarkable achievement, with the state accounting for nearly half of the nation's job growth. While some may argue that the comparison between the two numbers is not entirely accurate, I'd like to emphasize that Florida's raw job gains were impressive, ranking second in the nation to Texas. Moreover, when measured by percentage gains from the previous month, Florida would actually leapfrog Texas to No. 1 in the national rankings for job growth.\n\nIt's true that the numbers are subject to revision, and individual state figures have a larger margin for error than the national numbers. However, this doesn't diminish the significance of Florida's achievement in September. The state's bounceback in September may have been influenced by the lower job growth the previous month, and economists agree that a longer timeline is a better way to look at the numbers.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be some nuances to consider, the facts remain: Florida did exceptionally well in September, accounting for 84,500 of the nation's 194,000 new jobs. I urge you to consider the evidence presented and acknowledge the truth in this claim. Thank you.",

The numbers are not directly comparable, as they are calculated differently. Florida's job growth is impressive, but it's not accurate to say that it accounted for almost half of the nation's job growth output. Additionally, the numbers are subject to revision and may change significantly in subsequent months. A more accurate way to look at the numbers is to consider the percentage job gains over a longer timeline, which shows that Florida's performance is not as exceptional as claimed. Therefore, I conclude that the claim is HALF-TRUE.",

The man in the video claims that the goods are indeed in the warehouses, and the shortage is manufactured. This statement is supported by the fact that the port workers have indeed been working hard to move goods, and the port has been operating at maximum capacity.\n\nSecondly, the Medium essay by Ryan Johnson, a union truck driver, provides insight into the problems faced by truck drivers in the supply chain. He explains that long wait times for truck drivers at the ports discourage independent drivers from going to the ports, leading to a shortage of truckers and a backlog in the supply chain. This is a genuine problem that affects the movement of goods, and it's not a manufactured shortage.\n\nThirdly, Debra Glassman, a professor at the University of Washington, agrees that the cargo unloading at the port is just one link in the supply chain.

Instead, the vaccine delivers instructions to the body on how to make the spike protein, which is harmless and does not cause illness or infection. The spike proteins produced by the body's cells are broken down quickly by normal body processes, and the mRNA that teaches the body how to make the spike protein degrades within a few days. Furthermore, the vaccine has been shown to be 90.7% effective at preventing COVID-19 in children ages 5 to 11, with similar safety levels and side effects as older age groups. The claim is exaggerated and misleading, and there is no evidence to support the claim that the vaccine will cause illnesses to spread like wildfire in schools."

The article highlights the ongoing dispute in Wisconsin regarding the 2020 presidential election results, which was won by Democrat Joe Biden. Despite a recount and court rulings confirming the results, the dispute continues. This shows that the state of Wisconsin, not the federal government, is responsible for handling and resolving election disputes.\n\nFurthermore, the article quotes Dane County Clerk Scott McDonnell, who emphasizes the importance of local officials handling ballots to maintain a secure and uncompromised record.

The fact that the presidential election is always held on the same day of the same month (the first Tuesday in November) for every state demonstrates the federal government's involvement in setting the framework for elections.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that states have some degree of control over elections, but this control is limited by federal laws and the U.S. Constitution. For example, states can set their own laws governing voter registration, absentee ballots, and voter identification, but these laws must comply with federal standards. This suggests that the federal government has a significant influence on the overall direction of elections.\n\nThirdly, the evidence emphasizes the critical role of local governments in administering elections. County and municipal clerks are responsible for registering voters, handling absentee ballots, and tabulating votes, among other tasks.

However, this influence is limited to setting broad parameters, such as the date and manner of presidential elections, and does not extend to the day-to-day administration of elections.

This ensures that all states are held to the same standards and that the election process is consistent across the country.\n\nSecondly, the federal government provides funding and resources to states to help them administer their elections. For example, the Help America Vote Act of 2002 provided funding to states to upgrade their voting systems and improve election administration. This shows that the federal government is actively involved in supporting the election process and ensuring that states have the resources they need to run fair and secure elections.\n\nThirdly, the federal government has laws and regulations in place to protect the integrity of the election process.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2020, 73.3 million workers age 16 and older were paid on an hourly basis, which is about 55.5% of all workers. Among these hourly workers, 1.1 million, or 1.5%, were paid at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.\n\nMoreover, the data shows that single workers are more likely to earn the federal minimum wage or less. This is a crucial point, as it highlights the vulnerability of single individuals without children to poverty. The fact that they are more likely to be paid at or below the minimum wage increases their likelihood of being taxed into poverty.\n\nFurthermore, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report, cited by Rep. Gwen Moore, confirms that the federal tax code currently taxes about 5.8 million low-wage workers aged 19-65 into or deeper into poverty, because the payroll and federal income taxes they pay exceed any Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) they receive. This is a clear indication that the current tax system is indeed taxing low-wage workers into poverty.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence suggests that low-wage workers, particularly",

Gwen Moore's office, a July 2020 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, only focuses on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and its impact on low-wage workers, but it does not specifically address the claim's additional conditions of being single and having no children. The report highlights that the federal tax code taxes about 5.8 million low-wage workers into or deeper into poverty, but this does not necessarily apply to single individuals without children.\n\nSecondly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data on workers with hourly earnings at or below the prevailing Federal minimum wage shows that only 1.1 million workers, or 1.5%, were paid at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour in 2020. This suggests that the majority of low-wage workers are not being taxed into poverty.\n\nThirdly, the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also shows that single workers are more likely to earn the federal minimum wage or less, which may be due to various factors such as industry, occupation, and experience.

However, this is not the case. Many low-wage workers are married or have children, and their financial situations are likely to be different from those of single individuals without children.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument focuses on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which is a tax credit designed to help low-income working individuals and families. While it is true that some low-wage workers may not receive a significant EITC, this does not necessarily mean that they are being taxed into poverty. The EITC is just one part of the tax system, and other factors, such as deductions and exemptions, can also affect an individual's tax liability.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument ignores the fact that the tax system is designed to be progressive, meaning that higher-income individuals pay a higher tax rate than lower-income individuals.

This is particularly concerning in industries like hospitality, where low wages are common and workers often rely on tips to supplement their income.\n\nWhile some may argue that the claim is too broad or lacks specific definitions, I believe that the evidence presented demonstrates the reality that low-wage workers, particularly singles without children, are indeed being taxed into poverty. As Representative Moore so eloquently put it, \"What good is growth if we\u2019re taxing our workers into poverty?\" It is our responsibility to acknowledge this issue and work towards creating a more equitable tax system that supports the well-being of all workers, not just the wealthy few.

Those who served from 1957 through 1977 get $300 in additional earnings credit for each calendar quarter in which they received active-duty basic pay, and people who served from 1978 through 2001 get an additional $100 in earnings credit for every $300 in active-duty basic pay up to $1,200 per year. However, this is not a guaranteed increase in monthly Social Security benefits, as the increased earnings do not automatically mean an equal increase in monthly benefits.\n\nFurthermore, the claim implies that the $1,200 annual cap on the earnings credit for those who served from 1978 through 2001 is the amount added to the monthly Social Security benefit, which is not accurate.

Fox News host Tucker Carlson has been promoting this theory in his documentary series \"Patriot Purge,\" which suggests that the January 6 Capitol riot was a false flag operation orchestrated by the federal government to ensnare American citizens who supported former President Donald Trump.\n\nWhile some may dismiss this claim as a conspiracy theory, I'd like to highlight the evidence presented in the documentary series. For instance, the series features an interview with Darren Beattie, the founder of Revolver News, who claims that the FBI's involvement in the Whitmer kidnapping plot in October 2020 raises suspicions about their role in the January 6 riot. Beattie points out that Steven D'Antuono, the former director of the Detroit FBI field office, was promoted to help lead the FBI's Washington, D.C., office after his team successfully thwarted the Whitmer kidnapping plot. This, according to Beattie, is suspicious and suggests that the FBI may have been involved in orchestrating the January 6 riot.\n\nFurthermore, the documentary series also features an interview with Mark Ibrahim, a former DEA agent who claims that an unnamed FBI informant friend encouraged him to go inside the Capitol building on January 6.

However, a recent report in Science, Public Health Policy & the Law, a journal run by James Lyons-Weiler, has shed new light on this issue.\n\nThe report claims that the authors of the original CDC study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, made a significant error in their calculations. Specifically, they found that the miscarriage rate was seven to eight times higher than the CDC study presented. This discrepancy is crucial, as it suggests that the actual risk of spontaneous abortion following COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy may be higher than initially thought.\n\nThe CDC study, titled \"Preliminary Findings of mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine Safety in Pregnant Persons,\" used data from three federal reporting systems monitoring vaccine safety. They contacted 3,958 people enrolled in one of these systems about three months after they had received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Of those, 712 had given birth to healthy babies, 104 experienced miscarriages, and one had a stillbirth.\n\nHowever, the authors of the report in Lyons-Weiler's journal claim that the CDC study's findings are incorrect.

The claim is based on a flawed analysis of the CDC study, which manipulates and cherry-picks data to produce an inflated miscarriage rate.\n\nFirstly, the authors of the report in question excluded 700 people vaccinated in the third trimester, when the risk of miscarriage is reduced, and 700 people who were vaccinated after 20 weeks of pregnancy, the cutoff period that defines miscarriage. This is a clear bias in the selection of data, as it only looks at a narrow subset of pregnancies that are more likely to end in miscarriage.\n\nSecondly, the report uses a denominator that only counts people with loss of pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancies and induced abortions, to calculate the miscarriage rate. This is a flawed method, as it overrepresents the number of miscarriages and produces an inflated figure that cannot be applied to the general population.\n\nThirdly, the report's calculations are based on a sample size of only 127 completed pregnancies, which is a small and biased sample that is not representative of the general population. This is evident from the fact that the report's authors themselves acknowledge that a more precise assessment of the relationship between vaccination and miscarriage rates would require following these pregnancies to completion.\n\nFinally, the report's authors are criticized by experts, such as Dr. Jen Gunter, an OB-GYN, who points out that the data set is",

The report's use of a denominator that includes people with loss of pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancies and induced abortions, is a valid method for calculating the miscarriage rate. This approach acknowledges that miscarriage is a complex outcome that can occur for various reasons, including vaccination, and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between vaccination and miscarriage rates.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's claim that the report's sample size is too small is also unfounded.

The evidence states that \"usually, there's some dissatisfaction with the incumbent president that plays a role in the gubernatorial election. And the party that lost the presidential election a year earlier is often highly motivated for the gubernatorial race.\" This suggests that when the sitting president is from the same party as the gubernatorial candidate, it creates an unfavorable environment for the candidate.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence provides specific examples of instances where this trend has held true. For instance, in 2013, Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, won the governorship while Barack Obama was the sitting president, but this was an exception rather than the rule. The evidence also mentions that the previous time this trend was broken was in 1973, when Republican Richard Nixon was president and Mills Godwin, a Democrat who defected to the GOP, was elected governor.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence highlights that until 1969, Virginia had been dominated by a segregationist Democratic Party that won 21 straight gubernatorial elections, with 11 of those elections coinciding with Democratic presidents.

This directly contradicts the claim that no governor has ever won when they are the same party as the sitting president.\n\nSecondly, the evidence also mentions that Mills Godwin, a Democrat who defected to the GOP, was elected governor in 1973 while Richard Nixon, a Republican, was president.

The claim is not saying that no governor has ever won when they are the same party as the sitting president, but rather that it has been a reliable trend for 44 years that Virginians in odd-year gubernatorial races elect the candidate from the opposite party of the president. The exceptions my opponent pointed out are not representative of the overall trend, and do not disprove the claim.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument ignores the context of the exceptions they pointed out. Terry McAuliffe's win in 2013 was an anomaly, as it was a highly unusual election that saw a strong Democratic candidate in a year when the president was a Democrat. Similarly, Mills Godwin's win in 1973 was due to his defection from the Democratic Party, which is not representative of the typical situation where a governor is the same party as the sitting president.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument relies on a flawed understanding of the historical context of Virginia politics.

The trend is not absolute, as evidenced by the exceptions mentioned in the evidence itself. Terry McAuliffe's win in 2013 and Mills Godwin's win in 1973 demonstrate that the trend is not a hard and fast rule. In fact, the evidence suggests that the trend is more of a general pattern than a universal truth.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that the party that lost the presidential election a year earlier is often highly motivated for the gubernatorial race is not a guarantee of success. While it may be true that this party is motivated, it does not necessarily mean that they will win. The 2013 election, for example, saw a close race between McAuliffe and his Republican opponent, Ken Cuccinelli, with McAuliffe ultimately winning by a narrow margin.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's reliance on historical examples from the past is not sufficient to establish the claim as true.

As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the claim \"No governor in Virginia has ever won when...he or she is the same party as the sitting president\" is indeed TRUE.\n\nThroughout our discussion, we've seen numerous examples that support this claim. From President Joe Biden's recent statement to the historical trends and election results, it's clear that this phenomenon has been a consistent pattern in Virginia's gubernatorial elections.\n\nWe've seen that since 1973, when Republican Richard Nixon was president, only two governors have bucked this trend: Terry McAuliffe in 2013 and Mills Godwin in 1973. These exceptions only serve to reinforce the rule, as they demonstrate that even when a governor from the same party as the sitting president does win, it's a rare occurrence.\n\nFurthermore, we've seen that this trend is not limited to a specific time period or presidential administration. It's a consistent pattern that has persisted across multiple decades, with the only exceptions being the two instances mentioned earlier.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented today overwhelmingly supports the claim that no governor in Virginia has ever won when they are the same party as the sitting president.

As the evidence shows, Terry McAuliffe did win the election in 2013 while Barack Obama was the sitting president, and Linwood Holton won in 1969 while Richard Nixon was in office.\n\nIt's also important to note that the claim implies a causal relationship between the party of the sitting president and the outcome of the gubernatorial election, which may not be entirely accurate. As the article mentions, dissatisfaction with the incumbent president can play a role in the gubernatorial election, but it's not the only factor at play.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim has some truth to it, it's not entirely accurate to say that no governor in Virginia has ever won when they are the same party as the sitting president.

The study in question, conducted by researchers from two Swedish universities, introduced genetic material containing instructions to produce different proteins that make up the COVID-19 virus, including the spike protein, into isolated human kidney cells.\n\nThe study found that the spike proteins were present in the cell nucleus, which is the part of the cell that houses DNA. This is a crucial finding, as it suggests that the spike protein can indeed enter the nucleus and potentially interact with the DNA.\n\nFurthermore, the study also found that the presence of the spike protein led to a reduction in DNA repair efficiency, which is a significant concern. The researchers attributed this reduction to hindered recruitment of specific proteins involved in the repair process. This finding is supported by the evidence, as the study's results show a clear correlation between the presence of the spike protein and impaired DNA repair.\n\nIt's essential to note that this study was conducted in a lab setting, and the findings may not directly translate to real-life conditions outside the lab.

The study's findings should not be directly translated to the COVID-19 vaccines, which use modified versions of the spike protein. The modified spike protein in the vaccines prevents it from assuming the structure that would normally allow it to fuse with the membranes of other cells, unlike the spike protein coded for in the kidney cell study.\n\nSecondly, the study found that the spike proteins were present in the cell nucleus, but it did not establish a causal link between the presence of the spike protein and impaired DNA repair. The study only showed a correlation between the two, and it is unclear whether the presence of the spike protein itself or an overabundance of protein led to the findings.\n\nThirdly, the study's findings differ from previous studies that have found the spike protein to be located primarily outside the nucleus.

These items were not included in the final infrastructure bill that passed Congress.\n\nSecondly, the final infrastructure bill that passed Congress consisted almost entirely of traditional infrastructure provisions, such as roads, bridges, and major projects, passenger and freight rail, public transit, airports, ports and waterways, electric vehicles, road safety, reconnecting communities, electricity infrastructure, broadband, water infrastructure, and resiliency and Western water storage. These items make up the majority of the bill, but they are not the only items included.\n\nThirdly, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent group that scrutinizes federal spending, has categorized the infrastructure bill into different areas.

I firmly believe that Wisconsin is almost equally divided on partisan lines, and therefore, new Legislative maps should be drawn to represent that 50-50 split.\n\nFirstly, the evidence suggests that Wisconsin has indeed been split fairly evenly in a number of recent elections between Republicans and Democrats. As stated in the evidence, the Badger State has seen close margins between candidates in presidential, state Supreme Court, U.S. Senate, and gubernatorial races from 2014 onwards. For instance, in the 2020 presidential election and the 2018 race for governor, the margins were extremely close, with the latter being won by less than 30,000 votes.\n\nThis geographical divide is not a coincidence. It is a reflection of the state's political landscape, where both parties have a strong presence and a significant number of voters identify as independents. This is evident in the fact that Senate Minority Leader Janet Bewley, a Democrat, made an argument during the debate on the maps that the Legislature should reflect the state's partisan divide.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence provided by staffer Joseph Hoey, which breaks down votes in various elections, supports the claim that Wisconsin is almost equally divided on partisan lines.

The commission can only order election officials to conform their conduct to the law, not private individuals or entities.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim is partially accurate, it is also misleading and oversimplifies the complex issue of voting rights and the role of the commission. The commission's authority is limited to ensuring compliance with election laws, and it cannot force private facilities to allow special voting deputies inside. Therefore, I conclude that the claim is HALF-TRUE.",

After careful consideration, I conclude that the claim \"Only a court can decide that somebody is incompetent to vote\" and the commission \"cannot force facilities, private facilities, to allow special voting deputies\" inside is:\n\n[VERDICT]: TRUE\n\n[REASON]: The evidence presented from Wisconsin statutes, expert opinions, and court decisions supports the claim that only a court can declare someone incompetent to vote. Wisconsin Statute 54.25(2)(c)1.(g) explicitly states that a person may not be denied the right to register to vote or vote by reason of alleged incapability unless they have been adjudicated incompetent in this state. Additionally, the commission's authority is limited to ordering election officials to conform to the law, as stated in Wisconsin Statute 5.06(6), and it does not extend to private entities. The commission cannot force private facilities to allow special voting deputies inside, and it is up to the facilities to decide whether or not to allow them. The opponent's argument that the commission can take steps to ensure that special voting deputies are allowed into private care facilities is based on a misinterpretation of the law. Overall, the evidence and arguments presented support the claim that only a court can decide that somebody is incompetent to vote, and the commission cannot force facilities, private facilities, to allow special voting deputies inside."

I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that Iowa ranks 45th in the U.S. for internet connectivity.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to establish that the claim is not based on opinion or hearsay, but rather on verifiable evidence. According to U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne, who voted in favor of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Iowa ranks 45th in the nation for internet connectivity. This statement is not only made by a credible source but is also supported by data from BroadbandNow.com, a reputable organization that pulls its data from the Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nBroadbandNow.com's report states that Iowa's average state-wide speed is 74.3 megabits per second, with only 18.5% of Iowa's residents having low-price plan access. This data is not only consistent with Axne's statement but also with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds' own claims, who has mentioned Iowa's ranking of 45th in the nation and the state's slow internet speeds.\n\nIt's worth noting that even though some may argue that this ranking is not the only measure of internet connectivity, the fact remains that Iowa's ranking is consistently reported by multiple sources, including Axne and Reynolds, both of whom have a vested interest in improving Iowa's internet infrastructure.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence presented, I firmly believe that Iowa indeed ranks 45th in",

While it is true that Iowa ranks 45th according to BroadbandNow.com, which is a reputable source, the claim is misleading because it does not provide the full context of the situation.\n\nFirstly, the claim implies that Iowa's ranking is a fixed and unchanging fact, when in reality, the ranking is based on a snapshot of data from the Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Census Bureau. The ranking may change over time as new data becomes available and as efforts to improve internet connectivity in Iowa continue.\n\nSecondly, the claim does not take into account the efforts being made to improve internet connectivity in Iowa. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was passed in November, includes a $65 billion package to fund broadband expansion, with at least $100 million going to each state. This is a significant investment in Iowa's internet infrastructure, and it is likely to improve the state's ranking over time.\n\nFinally, the claim does not provide any information about the quality of internet connectivity in Iowa. While Iowa may rank 45th in terms of broadband access, it is possible that the quality of the internet service is still high. In fact, the evidence suggests that Iowa's average state-wide speed is 74.3 megabits per second, which is a respectable speed.\n\nIn conclusion, while Iowa may rank 45th in terms of broadband access, the claim is misleading",

However, internet connectivity is a complex issue that involves many factors, including rural-urban disparities, population density, and infrastructure. A ranking based solely on average speed may not accurately reflect the actual internet experience of Iowans.\n\nSecondly, the $550 billion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Axne voted in favor of, aims to improve internet connectivity across the country. The bill allocates $65 billion for broadband expansion, with a minimum of $100 million going to each state. This significant investment will undoubtedly improve Iowa's internet infrastructure and potentially boost its ranking in the future.\n\nFurthermore, while Axne and Reynolds have mentioned Iowa's ranking of 45th, they have also acknowledged the efforts being made to improve the state's internet connectivity. For instance, Axne's tweet mentions that her vote will \"change Iowa's ranking forever\" by sending the largest rural broadband investment in history to the President's desk.

Moreover, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds has also acknowledged this ranking, citing the same source, and has made a commitment to increasing broadband access in the state.\n\nIt's essential to note that this ranking is not just a partisan issue, as all six members of Iowa's Washington delegation, including those who voted against the infrastructure bill, have expressed support for broadband expansion. This bipartisan agreement underscores the severity of the issue and the need for action.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented overwhelmingly supports the claim that Iowa ranks 45th in the U.S. for internet connectivity.

This is in line with the New Jersey state Division of Elections' guidance on provisional ballots, which are intended for voters whose eligibility to vote cannot be confirmed at the polls on Election Day.\n\nSecondly, the poll worker did not provide the individual with a ballot without any conditions.

This is in line with the law, which requires that poll workers assess the eligibility of voters and only provide ballots to those who are entitled to vote.\n\nFinally, the evidence does not suggest that the poll worker knew or had reason to believe that the individual was not eligible to vote. The poll worker's uncertainty about the individual's eligibility is understandable, given the complexity of immigration laws and the fact that the individual presented a work visa as proof of his citizenship.

The poll worker's actions were in line with New Jersey state law, which allows provisional ballots to be provided to voters whose eligibility is uncertain. The claim relies on an incorrect assumption that the poll worker should have denied the individual a ballot altogether, but this is not supported by the evidence. The poll worker's uncertainty about the individual's eligibility is not an excuse for providing him with a ballot, but it does not constitute a crime. The evidence presented does not support the claim that a crime was committed, and the poll worker's actions were lawful and followed the correct procedure."

According to the United States Geological Survey, a 500-year storm is an event with a 1-in-500 chance of occurring, which translates to an annual probability of occurrence of around 0.2%. This means that such events are extremely rare and should not occur frequently.\n\nNow, let's look at the evidence. In July 2016, northern Wisconsin was hit by severe storms that caused devastating flash flooding, washing out roads, and damaging or destroying over 80 boats in Saxon Harbor. The rainfall totals reached 14 inches in some areas, which is a significant amount. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the storm was so severe that it left a broad swath of destruction that lingered for years.\n\nFast-forward to June 2018, and another heavy rain event hit the Northwoods, dropping 10 or more inches of rain in some areas. This event was also classified as a 500-year storm by the National Weather Service.\n\nFurthermore, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, has publicly stated that within two years, there were two 500-year events in Wisconsin.

The claim is misleading because it implies that the two storms were separate events, each with a 1-in-500 chance of occurring. However, the evidence suggests that the storms were not independent events, but rather consecutive events that occurred within a short period.\n\nThe evidence states that the 2016 storm \"led to flash flooding, which overwhelmed small creeks and rivers and washed out roads\" and that the 2018 storm \"pummeled the Northwoods again, dropping 10 or more inches of rain in some areas.\" This suggests that the two storms were part of a larger weather pattern that affected the region, rather than two separate events.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence does not provide clear evidence that the storms were truly 500-year events. While the National Weather Service data shows that some areas reached the threshold for a 500-year storm, it does not provide information on the overall probability of the storms occurring within a two-year period. In fact, the evidence suggests that the storms were part of a larger trend of severe weather events in the region, which may be related to climate change.\n\nAdditionally, the claim is misleading because it implies that the storms were unprecedented and rare, when in fact, the evidence suggests that similar storms have occurred in the region before.

However, the opponent's argument relies on the National Weather Service's classification of the storms as 500-year events, which is not a reliable source.

The data from the National Weather Service confirms that the 2016 storm reached 500-year levels in Saxon Harbor, and the 2018 storm did the same in other areas. Moreover, the storms in southern parts of the state during the same period also met the 500-year definition.\n\nIt's crucial to note that these events are not isolated incidents. The frequency and severity of extreme weather events are increasing due to climate change, as acknowledged by experts and reported by reputable sources like Vox.

The average monthly gain from February 2021 to October 2021 was 620,000, which is almost twice the rate during the last five months of the Trump administration. This indicates that the Biden administration has been successful in building upon the momentum of the previous administration and has made significant strides in creating new jobs.\n\nIn addition, the administration has also made significant progress in reducing the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

    "pro_opening": "Good evening, esteemed debaters and audience. I'm here to present the argument that New York is indeed leading the nation with the lowest imprisonment rate of any large state. \n\nFirstly, I'd like to establish the credibility of the evidence presented. The claim originates from the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, which is a reputable source of information on the state's prison system. Furthermore, the department defines a \"large state\" as one with a population of over 10 million people, which is a clear and objective criterion.\n\nNow, let's examine the evidence from the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics. According to the data released in October 2020, New York had an imprisonment rate of 224 people per 100,000 U.S. residents, which is significantly lower than the other large states. In fact, the rates in Texas and Georgia were 529 and 507, respectively, which is more than twice the rate in New York. Illinois, the closest large state to New York in terms of imprisonment rate, had a rate of 302 people per 100,000 residents.\n\nIt's essential to note that these rates include all sentenced prisoners, regardless of sex or age, under the jurisdiction of state or federal correctional authorities. This ensures that the comparison is fair and accurate.\n\nWhile it's true that New York doesn't have the lowest imprisonment rate across the country, the claim only concerns large states, and New York's rate",

This is problematic because it does not provide a complete picture of the national imprisonment rate. For example, states like Massachusetts, Maine, and Minnesota have lower imprisonment rates than New York, but they are not considered \"large states\" according to the definition used by the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision.\n\nSecondly, the claim does not provide context about the overall trend of imprisonment rates in the United States. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the imprisonment rate in the United States has been declining since 2000, and many states have seen significant reductions in their imprisonment rates. Therefore, it is misleading to suggest that New York is \"leading the nation\" with the lowest imprisonment rate when other states have also made significant progress in reducing their imprisonment rates.\n\nFinally, the claim relies on data from 2019, which may not reflect the current situation. The Vera Institute of Justice reported that imprisonment rates in spring 2021 were lowest in New York out of the nine largest states, but this data is not included in the claim. Therefore,",

The Department of Corrections and Community Supervision defines a large state as one with a population of over 10 million people, but this definition is not universally accepted. Other organizations, such as the Vera Institute of Justice, use different criteria to define large states.\n\nSecondly, the data from the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics only provides a snapshot of the imprisonment rate in 2019. However, imprisonment rates can fluctuate over time due to various factors such as changes in crime rates, sentencing policies, and prison reform efforts. Therefore, it's misleading to make a claim based on a single year's data.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument focuses solely on the imprisonment rate of large states, but neglects to consider the imprisonment rates of smaller states.

However, I will present some facts that support the claim as TRUE.\n\nOne crucial piece of evidence is that Newsom received the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine in April 2021, which has been linked to a tiny risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome, approximately 0.0008%. Although this risk is extremely low, it's still a possibility that cannot be ruled out.\n\nFurthermore, Newsom received a Moderna booster shot in October, which, as mentioned earlier, has been associated with a risk of Bell's palsy, a type of facial paralysis.

According to the evidence, Timothy Simpkins, a Black teen, was involved in a fight at his high school in Arlington, Texas, on October 6, 2021. During the fight, he fired shots from a handgun, injuring four people, including three seriously. He was arrested and released from the Tarrant County jail on October 7, 2021, after paying a $75,000 bond.\n\nOn the other hand, Kyle Rittenhouse, a white teen, was involved in a shooting during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 25, 2020.

He was released from the Kenosha County jail on November 20, 2020, after posting a $2 million bond.\n\nThe key point here is that both individuals were involved in violent incidents, but the consequences for their actions were vastly different.

The evidence shows that Rittenhouse is facing homicide charges, including one that carries a mandatory life prison sentence, whereas Simpkins is charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, which is a much lesser offense. This significant difference in the severity of the charges is not mentioned in the claim.\n\nSecondly, the claim is false because it implies that Rittenhouse was given more favorable treatment than Simpkins. However, the evidence shows that Simpkins was released from jail after paying a $75,000 bond, which is a relatively standard bail amount for a felony charge.

The headlines are often taken out of context, and the news clips are not presented in a way that provides a clear understanding of the circumstances surrounding the athlete's collapse. For example, the headline about the 24-year-old hockey player who died after collapsing on the ice is misleading, as it implies that the collapse was caused by the vaccine, when in fact, the cause of death was not specified.\n\nSecondly, the video fails to provide any credible scientific evidence to support the claim.

This is a crucial distinction, as it allows states to maintain control over how the funds are implemented, rather than the federal government taking over the entire industry.\n\nSecondly, the bill does not impose a \"government takeover\" on child care facilities.

The claim is based on a flawed analysis of the data and ignores crucial factors that affect mortality rates.\n\nFirstly, the opponent's argument relies on a misleading comparison between the mortality rates of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in the 10-59 age group. However, the data shows that the vaccinated population in this age group is skewed towards older individuals, which is a significant factor in the higher mortality rate. The footnote on the table provided by the ONS explicitly states that the vaccinated population will be older than the unvaccinated population due to age-based prioritization in the vaccine roll-out. This means that the comparison between the two groups is not apples-to-apples, and the higher mortality rate among vaccinated individuals is likely due to the age difference rather than any vaccine-related cause.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument ignores the age-adjusted risk of death involving COVID-19, which is 32 times greater in unvaccinated people than in fully vaccinated individuals. This suggests that the risk of death from COVID-19 is significantly higher for unvaccinated individuals, which is a critical factor in the higher mortality rate among unvaccinated individuals.\n\nFinally, the opponent's argument relies on a single chart from Berenson's blog post, which is not a reliable source of information.

While the data from the Office for National Statistics does show that the death rate among vaccinated individuals in the 10-59 age group is higher than among unvaccinated individuals, this is not due to vaccine-caused mortality. The explanation lies in the age distribution of the vaccinated population, which skews older due to the age-based prioritization in the vaccine roll-out. As mortality rates are higher for older people, this increases the mortality rates for the vaccinated population compared to the unvaccinated population.\n\nFurthermore, the government's own analysis of the data, which takes into account the age distribution in the population, shows that the age-adjusted risk of death involving COVID-19 is 32 times greater in unvaccinated people than in fully vaccinated individuals. This suggests that vaccination is actually associated with a lower risk of death from COVID-19.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is based on a flawed analysis of the data and ignores the important factor of age distribution in the vaccinated population.

The OECD report \"Education at a Glance 2021\" also includes private spending, which is a significant portion of the total expenditure on early childhood education and care. In the U.S., for example, private spending on early childhood education and care is estimated to be around $10,000 per child, which is not included in the $500 figure mentioned in the claim.\n\nSecondly, the claim does not take into account the different age ranges and definitions of early childhood care used in each country.

This conclusion is supported by credible sources, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Hamilton Project. The OECD's report \"Education at a Glance 2021\" provides figures for early childhood education programs targeting children under 3 years, and the Hamilton Project report provides a figure for the U.S. for children under age 3.

They explain that the motor doesn't consume power at zero speed, and only the car's electronics and heating/cooling systems use a small amount of power when the car is stationary. This means that electric vehicles can maintain their charge for an extended period, even in a traffic jam.\n\nFurthermore, the British consumer watchdog group's test of an electric vehicle's battery performance during a simulated traffic jam found that the car's main 77 kWh battery lost only 2% of its power after 75 minutes of using various functions, equivalent to 8 miles of driving range. This demonstrates that electric vehicles can withstand the demands of a traffic jam without running out of power.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that electric vehicles are more likely to fail in traffic jams is FALSE. Electric vehicles are designed to be efficient and can maintain their charge for an extended period, even in a",

The evidence presented by experts, including David Howey and Peter Wells, suggests that electric vehicles use little battery power when at a standstill and can maintain their charge for an extended period, even in a traffic jam.

Overall, the claim is FALSE because it is based on a misunderstanding of the capabilities of electric vehicles."

This is a critical omission, as many European countries have exceptions for health, socioeconomic, or other reasons that can extend the legal period for abortion to 22 weeks or more.\n\nThirdly, the report's findings are not supported by other sources. The amicus curiae brief filed by European law professors in the Mississippi case notes that abortion is permitted through at least 22 weeks of pregnancy in 37 states and through 18-21 weeks in a further three, either on request, or on broad socioeconomic grounds, or on a criterion that does not entail a risk to her",

This analysis is an independent assessment, not a biased opinion.\n\nSecondly, the analysis specifically focuses on the add-on payments for certain drugs administered in doctors' offices, which are particularly important to oncologists. These payments are based on the average sales price of the drug, plus a 6% add-on payment to cover overhead, staffing, and the effort that goes into purchasing the drug. The 6% add-on payment has the unintended consequence of incentivizing expensive drugs over lower-cost options.\n\nThirdly, the Build Back Better Act, as passed by the House, would empower the federal government to negotiate prices for a small set of high-priced drugs, including those used by oncologists under Part B, starting in 2025.

According to the evidence, on November 26, 2021, President Biden issued a proclamation blocking travel from eight African countries - Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe - to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This is a verifiable fact, supported by the official proclamation and multiple news sources.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second part of the claim, which states that President Biden refuses to require a COVID-19 test for illegal immigrants crossing the Southern border. The evidence suggests that this is also true. According to a report by the Office of the Inspector General in the Department of Health Services, an inspection found that U.S. Customs and Border Control was not testing migrants, and was not required to do so, relying instead on local public health systems to test symptomatic individuals. Additionally, a New York Times report from April 2021 revealed that U.S. authorities were failing to test migrants crossing into the U.S. via the southern border, citing insufficient time and space to conduct more widespread testing.\n\nFurthermore,",

However, this restriction only applied to non-U.S. citizens, and U.S. citizens were exempt from the travel ban. This is an important distinction, as it suggests that the administration was taking a targeted approach to mitigate the spread of the virus, rather than imposing a blanket ban on all travel.\n\nSecondly, the claim that Biden \"refuses to require a #COVID19 test for illegal immigrants crossing our Southern border\" is misleading. While it is true that the U.S. Border Patrol does not require COVID-19 testing for all immigrants entering the country, this is not because the administration is refusing to require testing. Rather, the U.S. Customs and Border Control does not have the authority to enforce testing procedures at the border, and instead relies on local public health systems to test symptomatic individuals.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the administration has been working to increase testing capacity and availability at the border.

The claim is not about the administration's approach to U.S. citizens, but rather about its approach to illegal immigrants crossing the Southern border. The fact that U.S. citizens were exempt from the travel ban does not change the fact that the administration did restrict travel from eight African countries in response to the Omicron variant.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that the administration is not refusing to require COVID-19 testing for illegal immigrants crossing the Southern border, but rather lacks the authority to do so, is a distinction without a difference. The fact remains that the administration has not implemented a policy requiring COVID-19 testing for illegal immigrants crossing the Southern border, despite the fact that it has implemented such a policy for international travelers. This is a clear inconsistency and a failure to apply a consistent standard to all individuals entering the country.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument that the administration is working to increase testing capacity and availability at the border is not a justification for the lack of testing for illegal immigrants.

This metric takes into account wage and salary income, government transfer payments, and taxes, providing a comprehensive picture of the average American's financial situation.\n\nAccording to the data, per capita, inflation-adjusted personal disposable income has been steadily rising since the first quarter of 2016.

These payments were enacted as a response to the pandemic and are not a long-term solution to the financial struggles of American families.\n\nSecondly, the claim does not account for the significant increase in personal saving rates during the pandemic, which is a result of Americans being unable to spend on many services, such as restaurants and tourism.

The evidence presented shows that the video in question is a deliberate misuse of the rapid COVID-19 test device, and the results are not a reliable indicator of COVID-19 presence in tap water.\n\nFirstly, the video shows the test device being used with tap water, which is explicitly against the manufacturer's instructions. Abbott Laboratories, the company that makes the test device, has clearly stated that the device is not designed to be used with liquids, including tap water. This misuse of the device renders the test results unreliable and invalid.\n\nSecondly, the video does not follow the proper testing procedure outlined in the instructions. The test results are determined after 15 minutes, not the little over two minutes shown in the video. This lack of adherence to the testing protocol further undermines the validity of the results.\n\nThirdly, the doctor who wrote the tweet, Dr. Patrick Phillips, has a history of spreading misinformation about COVID-19. He was recently accused by health authorities in Canada of spreading misinformation and was barred from providing people exemptions for masks, COVID-19 vaccines, and testing. This raises serious concerns about the credibility of his claims.\n\nLastly, the World Health Organization has explicitly stated that COVID-19 is not transmissible through water.

This statement was supported by research from Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, who found 161 examples of the Senate establishing work-arounds to the ordinary 60-vote requirement to push past a filibuster in her 2017 book \"Exceptions to the Rule: The Politics of Filibuster Limitations in the U.S. Senate\".\n\nThe evidence also highlights that these carve-outs are not all equal, and some are more significant than others.

According to the evidence provided, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wrote in an August 17, 2021, letter to Congress that there were as many as 15,000 Americans in Afghanistan needing evacuation. This figure was based on the known number of Americans in the country and the assumption that many would need evacuation given the Taliban's pending takeover.\n\nFurthermore, Blinken himself stated on August 25, 2021, that the number of American citizens who wanted to leave was closer to about 6,000. This discrepancy in numbers suggests that there were indeed a significant number of Americans who remained in Afghanistan and did not want to leave.\n\nIt's also important to note that not everyone who was left behind was necessarily a U.S. citizen. Some individuals may have had dual citizenship, and others may have chosen to stay in the country for various reasons.

Some had dual citizenship, and not all of them wanted to leave the country. This is a crucial point that is often overlooked in the debate. The claim implies that all individuals who were left behind were American citizens who wanted to leave, which is not the case.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that the initial estimate of 15,000 Americans in Afghanistan was based on the known number of Americans in the country and the assumption that many would need evacuation due to the Taliban's takeover. However, this estimate was later revised to around 6,000 after the State Department and embassy workers heard from individuals who wished to leave the country. This suggests that the initial estimate was an overestimation, and the actual number of Americans who wanted to leave was much lower.\n\nThirdly, the claim implies that the Biden administration abandoned these individuals to terrorists, which is a misleading characterization. The administration made efforts to evacuate as many Americans as possible, and the fact that some individuals were left behind does not necessarily mean that they were abandoned.

This means that stores have the option to ask for proof of vaccination, but it is not mandatory.\n\nSecondly, the policy does not prohibit unvaccinated people from shopping for food in New Brunswick or the rest of Canada. The evidence states that the policy does not preclude people who are unvaccinated from shopping for food in that province or the rest of the country.\n\nThirdly, the Facebook video is misrepresenting the policy by stating that unvaccinated people cannot shop for groceries. The video is using sensational language, such as \"tyranny\" and \"fascist f---king reality,\" to create a false narrative that is not supported by the evidence.\n\nLastly, the evidence also shows that major national grocery retailers in Canada, such as Loblaw Companies Limited, have stated that they will not be asking customers for proof of vaccination.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim \"Canada joins the no jab, no",

It states that New Brunswick has become the first Canadian province to allow the banning of unvaccinated shoppers, but this is not accurate. The policy does not require any retail store to ask for proof of vaccination, and it does not preclude people who are unvaccinated from shopping for food in the province or the rest of the country.\n\nSecondly, the video quotes New Brunswick Health Minister Dorothy Shephard as saying that stores have the option of requiring proof of vaccination from all patrons, but it's left up to individual businesses to decide. This does not mean that the province has implemented a policy that restricts access to food for the unvaccinated. Rather, it means that businesses have the discretion to choose whether or not to require proof of vaccination, and many may choose not to do so.\n\nThirdly, the video mentions that some retailers in New Brunswick plan to enforce physical distancing instead of requiring proof of vaccination.

The evidence presented shows that the province of New Brunswick has enacted a policy allowing grocery stores to ban unvaccinated shoppers, making it the first Canadian province to do so. This policy is not mandatory, but rather an option for individual businesses to implement. While some major retailers in the province have chosen not to require proof of vaccination, others may choose to do so. This development is a significant step towards the \"no jab, no food\" trend, as it creates a situation where unvaccinated individuals may face restrictions or even bans on accessing essential services like grocery shopping.\n\nThe evidence also highlights the concerns and fears of some individuals, such as the woman in the Facebook video, who believe that this policy is an example of \"tyranny\" and \"fascist\" measures. While these claims may be subjective and emotive, the fact remains that the policy has been enacted and is now in place in New Brunswick.\n\nIn light of this evidence, I firmly believe that the claim \"Canada joins the no jab, no food trend\" is TRUE, and it is essential to acknowledge and discuss the implications of this development on individual freedoms and public health.",

According to the evidence, Bob Cratchit, the poor clerk in Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\", earned 15 shillings a week, which is equivalent to $530.27 a week or $27,574 a year, adjusted for inflation. This is a significant amount of money, especially considering the time period.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the current minimum wage in the United States. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, which translates to $15,080 a year. This is significantly lower than Bob Cratchit's annual income. In fact, it's less than half of what he earned.\n\nFurthermore, many cities and states have higher minimum wages than the federal level. For example, the highest minimum wage in the country is $15.20 in the District of Columbia. However, even with these higher minimum wages, many Americans on minimum wage still earn less than Bob Cratchit's equivalent income.\n\nThe experts quoted in the article also support this claim.

The evidence provided by George Boyer, a professor of economics, highlights the difficulties in making such a comparison. He notes that there are various ways to calculate the equivalent value of 15 shillings in 1840, and different people would get different answers. Additionally, the value of the dollar in terms of British pounds has changed significantly over time, making it even more challenging to make a meaningful comparison.\n\nSecondly, the claim is based on a misinterpretation of Bob Cratchit's character in A Christmas Carol. Cratchit is not an allegory for destitution, as he is a skilled worker who makes a decent living. In fact, according to Vincent Geloso, an assistant professor of economics, Cratchit's annual income of 39 pounds was only a bit less than the U.K. average of 57 pounds in 1846. This suggests that Cratchit was not destitute, but rather a middle-class worker.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the fact that many Americans on minimum wage today are not destitute.

Bob Cratchit's wage in \"A Christmas Carol\" was a meager 15 shillings a week, equivalent to approximately $27,574 per year in today's dollars.

The evidence provided by Families Against Fentanyl is based on a three-year period, from April 2018 to April 2021, which may not be representative of the overall trend. Overall, while Fentanyl overdose deaths are a significant concern, the claim is an exaggeration and not entirely accurate."

However, the claim is rooted in the fact that squalene, a compound found in shark livers, is sometimes used as an adjuvant in vaccines to boost immunity.\n\nAccording to Shark Allies, an advocacy group, 500,000 sharks could be potentially killed to meet the demand of mass-producing a vaccine. This figure is based on the assumption that squalene is used in the production of vaccines, which is true. Squalene is indeed used in some vaccines, including the Fluad influenza vaccine approved in the US for people 65 and older.\n\nMoreover, the World Health Organization's vaccine tracker lists three COVID-19 vaccines that have squalene as an ingredient, although none of these have reached approval stages. Additionally, none of the vaccines approved for use in the US or globally contain squalene as an adjuvant.\n\nNow, it's crucial to note that the claim is not entirely accurate because it implies that half a million sharks are directly killed to make the COVID-19 vaccine.

According to an article published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine, covering the lower half of the face reduces the ability to communicate, interpret, and mimic the expressions of those with whom we interact. This can lead to a decrease in positive emotions becoming recognizable, and negative emotions being amplified. As a result, bonding between teachers and learners, group cohesion, and learning itself can be impaired.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this article is not based on scientific study, and an ethical statement at the end of the piece notes that \"no data was collected for this opinion paper.\" This raises concerns about the validity of the claims made in the article.\n\nOn the other hand, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published a Science brief that notes that limited available data indicates",

I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that \"A tragic end today\" for CNN's Sanjay Gupta is a social media death hoax.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to highlight the fact that Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a renowned neurosurgeon and CNN's chief medical correspondent, is indeed alive and well. This is evident from his recent appearances on CNN and MSNBC, where he discussed the CDC's changes to its COVID-19 isolation guidelines and promoted his book, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, a search of Dr. Gupta's official social media accounts reveals no mention of his death. In fact, he has posted on Twitter in the days since December 23, including a tweet shared on January 10. This lack of any official confirmation or announcement of his passing on his social media channels strongly suggests that the claim of his death is false.\n\nAdditionally, a CNN spokesperson has confirmed that Dr. Gupta is alive and well, which further reinforces the notion that the claim is a hoax.\n\nIt's also important to note that the article linked to in the initial post is not a legitimate CNN article. A closer examination of the website reveals that it's actually an advertisement, and clicking on any links leads to different sites selling CBD gummies. This is a clear indication of a fake news site designed to deceive and mislead readers.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented clearly shows that the claim \"A tragic end today\" for CNN's Sanjay Gupta",

However, the WHO also stated that the infection fatality rate varies widely across studies and populations, and that the true rate may be different. This uncertainty undermines the opponent's claim that the WHO has conclusively stated that COVID-19 is not as deadly as the flu.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument relies on the CDC's estimate of 0.7% infection fatality rate for COVID-19 in the US. However, this estimate is based on a single study and may not be representative of the global situation.

The post suggests that if half the cars in the traffic jam were electric vehicles, they would have run out of battery power, leaving hundreds of people stranded in freezing temperatures without a heated vehicle. This is a significant concern, as the post emphasizes that electric cars would become \"roadblocks\" to gasoline-powered vehicles.\n\nSecondly, the range of an electric vehicle varies widely by model, from 110 miles to up to 373 miles. However, in a traffic jam, an electric vehicle's motor doesn't run when the car is stationary, so the only draw on the battery is for the heating system and other electrical accessories. This means that electric vehicles would not be able to move, and their batteries would drain faster than gasoline-powered vehicles.\n\nThirdly, experts like Peter Wells and Jeremy Michalek have provided valuable insights into the energy capacity of electric vehicle batteries.

However, as the evidence suggests, electric vehicles can operate for an extended period while idling, as they do not consume much power when stationary. In fact, the heating system and other electrical accessories are the only draws on the battery, which is a much smaller amount of power compared to a gasoline-powered vehicle.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that electric vehicles have a much more efficient heating system compared to gasoline-powered vehicles.

While some may argue that electric vehicles would be more prone to failure, the facts suggest otherwise. In a traffic jam, an electric vehicle's motor doesn't run, and the only draw on the battery is for the heating system and other accessories.

This unprecedented speed of spread is a testament to the virus's contagiousness and ability to adapt quickly.\n\nOne way to quantify the spread of a virus is to measure its basic reproduction number (R0), which indicates the average number of people an infected person can infect in a population where no one has been exposed or vaccinated. According to the evidence, the R0 for measles is between 12 and 18, while Omicron's R0 is estimated to be between 1.5 to 2 times more than the delta variant, which means each sick person can infect between 7 and 14 people.\n\nAnother measure of spread is the effective reproduction number (Rt), which takes into account factors such as vaccination levels and immunity from prior exposure.

This is a different measure of spread than the basic reproduction number (R0) or the effective reproduction number (Rt), which measure the transmission rate of the virus within a population.\n\nIn fact, the evidence suggests that Omicron is not only the fastest-spreading virus in terms of its global spread, but also in terms of its ability to spread rapidly within a population.

However, these numbers are not the only measures of a virus's spread, and they do not provide a complete picture of the virus's contagiousness.\n\nFor example, measles has a higher R0 than Omicron, but it takes longer for measles to spread from person to person. This means that while measles may be more contagious in the long run, Omicron may be more contagious in the short run. Additionally, the Rt value for Omicron is not necessarily a direct comparison to other viruses, as it is influenced by factors such as vaccination levels and immunity from prior exposure.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument relies on a single expert's opinion, William Hanage, who attributes the rapid spread of Omicron to its shorter generation time.

While it's true that testing has played a crucial role in tracking the spread of the virus, it's not the sole factor.\n\nIn reality, the pandemic has persisted due to various factors, including the virus's ability to mutate and adapt, the lack of herd immunity, and the ongoing transmission of the virus through human-to-human contact. Stopping testing would not eliminate the virus; it would only eliminate the data that helps us understand its spread and track its impact.\n\nMoreover, as Professor Mays pointed out, widespread testing and vaccinations have changed the nature of the pandemic. While some people may develop mild symptoms, they are still infectious and can spread the virus to others. Stopping testing would not make the virus disappear; it would only make it more difficult to track and contain.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that stopping testing would make the pandemic disappear is a flawed and oversimplified view.

According to the evidence, he said that more than 140 police officers were injured during the attack. This statement is supported by the fact that the FBI does keep track of the number of law enforcement officers who were killed and assaulted in the line of duty, and officers who died from natural causes, by suicide, or from their own personal situations are not considered as line of duty deaths and assaults.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence also suggests that Officer Brian Sicknick, who was pepper sprayed twice during the rioting, died a day later after suffering two strokes. Although the chief medical examiner determined that Sicknick died of natural causes, it is clear that the events of that day played a role in his condition. This is supported by the fact that a bipartisan Senate report released in June 2021 found that a total of seven people died in connection to the attack, including three law enforcement officers, including Sicknick, and four people who attended the pro-Trump rally that turned into a violent assault on the Capitol.\n\nIn conclusion, while President Biden did not say \"dozens of police were killed\" on Jan. 6, he did",

This highlights the need for increased police presence and resources to address these issues.\n\nNow, let's examine the evidence provided. According to the article, the Common Council voted 13-0 to approve a $1.76 billion budget for 2022 that aimed to limit the decrease in police officer positions by authorizing 195 new recruits funded from the tax levy, not from federal funds. This is a clear indication that the city is committed to increasing the number of police officers on the force.\n\nFurthermore, the article states that the budget office was still expecting an overall decrease of about two-dozen officer positions in 2022, even with the additional 195 new recruits. This means that the 195 new recruits are indeed an increase in the number of police officers on the force.\n\nAdditionally, the article mentions that an additional 30 officers were hired through a COPS grant, which is a federal program that provides funding for new police officers.

This means that there was no vaccine mandate to begin with, and therefore, it's not possible for Japan to have dropped one.\n\nSecondly, the claim that Japan has placed a myocarditis warning on the label is partially true.

This warning was issued in response to the rare but serious side effects.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that Japan did not place this warning on the label. The FDA issued the warning, and it's not specific to Japan.

The evidence states that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a myocarditis warning on vaccine labels in response to rare incidences of heart inflammation in people receiving mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, and Japan followed suit.

This is not unique to China, but it is a possibility that cannot be ruled out.

As Thornton Matheson from the Tax Policy Center points out, the bill overall does not encourage offshoring. This suggests that the law is not designed to specifically benefit companies that outsource jobs to China.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument relies heavily on the idea that the law's reduction in the top corporate rate from 35% to 21% makes it more attractive for companies to put assembly lines on foreign soil. However, this is not necessarily the case.

The law's reduction in the top corporate rate from 35% to 21% and the change in foreign income taxation rules did make it more attractive for companies to put more assembly lines on foreign soil, as the New York Times reported.\n\nFurthermore, the data shows that thousands of jobs were moved to China after the tax law was adopted. While it's true that the data doesn't necessarily prove causality, it's reasonable to infer that the tax law played a role in these job moves. The fact that some companies may have shifted jobs to China, while others shifted jobs to other countries, doesn't diminish the fact that the tax law created an environment that encouraged offshoring.\n\nAdditionally, the law's provision allowing companies to escape U.S. corporate taxes on foreign earnings if those earnings are smaller than 10% of their tangible foreign assets is another example of how the law rewarded companies that outsource to China.

The video by Ivory Hecker, a reputable journalist, highlights the astonishing fact that there are over 120,000 active voters in Wisconsin who have been registered to vote for over 100 years. This is not a trivial matter, as it raises serious questions about the integrity of the electoral process.\n\nThe evidence suggests that these voters are not necessarily fraudulent or deceased, but rather, they are a result of administrative errors and the merging of municipal records into a statewide system. The Wisconsin Elections Commission has acknowledged that the default dates of 1900 and 1918 were used in the past when municipal records lacked a date of birth or registration date.\n\nFurthermore, the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and the subsequent implementation of the WisVote database have led to the migration of hundreds of municipal records into a state system, resulting in the inclusion of default dates.

While it is true that there are over 120,000 active voters in Wisconsin with registration dates dating back to 1918, this does not necessarily imply voter fraud or padding of the voter rolls.\n\nThe evidence suggests that these older registration dates are largely the result of administrative errors and the merging of municipal records into a statewide system. Prior to 2005, voter registration was not required in municipalities with less than 5,000 individuals, and election officials tracked their own voter registration information through various databases and spreadsheets. When these records were migrated into the statewide system, default dates were entered for voters who lacked a date of birth or initial date of registration.\n\nThe Wisconsin Elections Commission has explained that the older dates are not a sign of voter fraud, but rather a result of the state's efforts to consolidate and standardize voter registration records. Since 2006, many of these default dates have been updated as voters move or update their information, and the voter's former record with the default dates is merged with the new record.\n\nWhile the claim may be sensationalized and misleading, it is not entirely false.

According to publicly available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the statistics are stark. Unvaccinated individuals are 20 times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to those who are fully vaccinated with additional or booster doses.\n\nMoreover, the CDC data also shows that unvaccinated people are 10 times more likely to test positive for COVID-19. This is a significant difference, highlighting the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nFurthermore, the data from the Texas Department of State Health Services supports Psaki's claims.

However, the CDC data also shows that children under 18 who are unvaccinated are at a higher risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 compared to those who are fully vaccinated. This suggests that the risk of hospitalization and death is not solely dependent on vaccination status, but also on age.\n\nSecondly, the claim does not account for other factors that contribute to the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19, such as underlying health conditions, age, and socioeconomic status. For example, people with underlying health conditions, regardless of their vaccination status, are at a higher risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. Similarly, older adults and those with lower socioeconomic status may be more likely to experience worse health outcomes due to limited access to healthcare and other social determinants of health.\n\nThirdly, the claim relies on data from October and November 2021, which may not be representative of the current situation.

The data shows that unvaccinated individuals are 10 times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 and 20 times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to those who are fully vaccinated with additional or booster doses. Additionally, the data on hospitalizations reveals that unvaccinated adults ages 18 and older are hospitalized with COVID-19 at a rate of about 67.8 per 100,000, while fully vaccinated individuals are hospitalized at a rate of about 3.9 per 100,000, making the unvaccinated 17 times more likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19. While the Con Agent raised some valid points, such as the limitations of the data and the importance of considering other factors that contribute to the risk of hospitalization and death, the evidence presented by the Pro Agent is more convincing and supports the claim that the claim is TRUE."

The White House pointed to excerpts from three speeches Biden made in recent years, which mentioned an incident in Delaware in the 1950s where people gathered to protest the sale of a home to a Black couple. However, police were called to the home, and there were a few arrests, but no evidence that Biden was among them.\n\nSecondly, Biden's own accounts of the event are inconsistent. In some speeches, he uses the term \"arrested,\" while in others, he uses phrases like \"the police brought you back\" or \"the police drove you home.\" This lack of consistency raises questions about the accuracy of his claims.\n\nThirdly, contemporary newspaper articles confirm that there were protests at two homes near where Biden was growing up in Delaware in 1959.

    "pro_opening": "Good evening, esteemed debaters. I'm here to present the argument that the claim \"We've brought in more than $81 billion in economic investment, more than four times any previous administration\" is indeed TRUE.\n\nAs stated by Governor Northam himself, the data from the Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) shows that his administration has brought in more than $81 billion in economic investment, exceeding the total investment of his six most recent predecessors. This is a staggering figure that demonstrates the significant progress made by the current administration in attracting businesses and investments to the state.\n\nThe evidence provided by the VEDP records shows that Northam-announced projects are expected to bring in more than four times the investment of his predecessors, with figures ranging from $81.4 billion under Northam to $18.7 billion under Terry McAuliffe, $13.7 billion under Bob McDonnell, $11.8 billion under Tim Kaine, $13 billion under Mark Warner, $12.3 billion under Jim Gilmore, and $10.7 billion under George Allen.\n\nIt's essential to note that these figures represent only deals that governors publicly announced, which are different from ironclad contracts. While some deals may not come to fruition or may not meet expectations, the sheer magnitude of the investment announced under Northam's administration is a testament to the state's attractiveness to businesses and investors.\n\nFurthermore, the data shows that Northam's administration has been successful in targeting new businesses and creative",

As the evidence states, \"Some of the announced deals never come into fruition, others never meet expectations and some exceed them.\" This means that the $81 billion figure is likely inflated and may not accurately reflect the actual economic impact of the governor's policies.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence highlights that the largest project announced by McAuliffe, a $2 billion paper plant, never materialized, yet it is still counted in the total investment figure. This suggests that the governor's claim is based on incomplete or inaccurate data.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence notes that some deals take years to work out, and the governor who began negotiations with a company may not be the one who announces an agreement. This means that the governor's claim may not accurately reflect the actual economic impact of his policies, as some projects may have been initiated by previous administrations.\n\nFinally, the evidence suggests that a more meaningful measure of economic growth is the number of jobs created, rather than the total amount of investment. According to the evidence, Northam ranks third among his six predecessors in terms of job creation, which suggests that his economic policies may not have had a significant impact on job growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that \"We\u2019ve brought in more than $81 billion",

While it is possible that some projects may not meet expectations, the VEDP's data is based on publicly announced deals, which are subject to scrutiny and verification.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument that the largest project announced by McAuliffe, a $2 billion paper plant, never materialized is not a valid criticism of the current administration's claim. The fact that the project did not come to fruition does not mean that the $81 billion figure is inflated. Instead, it highlights the importance of verifying the accuracy of announced deals and the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of economic development projects.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument that some deals take years to work out and that the governor who began negotiations with a company may not be the one who announces an agreement is a valid point, but it does not necessarily undermine the claim.

As mentioned in the article, some deals may not come to fruition or may not meet expectations, which means that the actual investment may be lower than the announced figures. This is evident in the case of the Tranlin Inc. deal, which was announced by McAuliffe but never materialized.\n\nSecondly, the data does not account for the timing of the deals. Some deals may have been negotiated by previous administrations but announced by Northam, which would artificially inflate his numbers. For example, the Amazon deal was negotiated by McAuliffe's administration but announced by Northam, which means that the credit for the deal should be shared between the two administrations.\n\nThirdly, the claim is based on expected investment, not actual investment.

Moreover, the data shows that Northam-announced projects are expected to bring more than four times the investment of his six most recent predecessors.\n\nIt's also important to note that the numbers represent a combination of both expansions of existing companies in Virginia and new companies locating in the state. This diversification of investments demonstrates the governor's successful efforts to attract a wide range of businesses to the state.\n\nOf course, as with any economic development projects, there are always uncertainties and potential caveats. However, the data suggests that Northam's administration has made significant progress in promoting economic growth and job creation in Virginia.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence supports the claim that Governor Northam's administration has brought in more than $81 billion in economic investment, a remarkable achievement that exceeds the records of his predecessors.

Additionally, the image of the emaciated polar bear is a real image taken in 2015, and it does demonstrate the impact of climate change on polar bears.\n\nFurthermore, while it is true that the bear's condition was not worsened over a 10-year period from 2009 to 2019, it is also true that climate change has had a significant impact on polar bears over the past decade. The reduction in sea ice, which is a crucial habitat for polar bears, has led to increased malnutrition and reduced body condition in many bears. This is a well-documented phenomenon, and it is supported by scientific research.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim may have been exaggerated or misleading, it is not entirely false. The images used in the post do demonstrate the impact of climate change",

While it is true that the images presented are misleading and do not accurately depict the changes that occurred over the 10-year period, the claim is not entirely false.\n\nFirstly, the images do show a dramatic change in the Greenland ice sheet and a polar bear's condition, even if they are not accurately dated. The post does not claim that the images show a direct cause-and-effect relationship between climate change and the changes depicted, but rather highlights the alarming rate of ice loss and the impact on polar bears.\n\nSecondly, while the post may exaggerate the extent of the ice loss in Greenland, it is true that the ice sheet has been experiencing significant melting and loss in recent years. NASA's data shows that Greenland did experience record ice loss in 2019, which is a concerning trend.\n\nThirdly, while the image of the emaciated bear may not have been taken in 2019, it is still a relevant example of the impact of climate change on polar bears. The bear's poor condition is likely a result of the changing environment and reduced access to food and habitat, which is a consequence of climate change.\n\nFinally, while the post's claim that the Greenland ice sheet will disappear in \"many centuries\" at current warming rates may be an oversimplification, it is not entirely inaccurate. Climate change is indeed affecting the ice sheet, and it is expected to continue to do so in the future.\n\nIn conclusion",

The post implies that the images depict changes that happened between 2009 and 2019, but this is not the case.

The ice sheet is not on the verge of disappearing, and it would take many centuries at current warming rates for it to do so. Additionally, the bear's poor condition was not documented in 2019, but rather in 2015.\n\nIn conclusion, while climate change is a serious issue that requires our attention and action, the claim that images show how climate change destroyed the Greenland ice sheet and harmed a polar bear from 2009 to 2019 is an exaggeration and a misrepresentation of the facts.

However, the claim being made is that this pneumonia is not an infection, but rather an allergic reaction.\n\nThe evidence presented suggests that Dr. Shankara Chetty, a natural science biologist and general family practitioner, has observed that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia symptoms suddenly worsen after several days, unlike regular pneumonia. He has also noted that patients' oxygen flow is not restricted, but they experience a rapid restriction in lung expansion, which is similar to an allergic reaction.\n\nFurthermore, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology defines mast cells as allergy cells responsible for immediate allergic reactions. During an allergic reaction, these cells release mediators, which can bring on symptoms such as swelling or shortness of breath. The release of these mediators is called degranulation.\n\nDr. Chetty's findings, as cited in the Facebook posts, suggest that the symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia are consistent with an allergic reaction, rather than an infection.

COVID-19 pneumonia is a viral infection that causes inflammation and damage to the lungs, leading to symptoms such as cough, fever, and shortness of breath. It is not an allergic reaction, as the body's immune system is responding to the presence of the virus, not an allergen.\n\nSecondly, the claim is based on a misinterpretation of the role of mast cells in the body.

They cite the 7% inflation rate and the 2.3% decline in the median American worker's purchasing power as evidence.\n\nThe Con Agent, on the other hand, argues that the claim is misleading because it oversimplifies the relationship between inflation and wages. They point out that wages rose by 4.7% during the same period, which means that the median American worker was not 7% poorer. They also argue that the claim ignores the impact of rising incomes on household incomes and the complexity of the issue.\n\nAfter evaluating the arguments and evidence, I conclude that the claim \"People are 7% poorer now because of Biden inflation\" is HALF-TRUE.\n\nThe reason for this verdict is that while the 7% inflation rate in 2021 is a significant economic problem, the claim oversimplifies the relationship between inflation and wages. The data shows that wages rose by 4.7% during the same period, which means that the median American worker was not 7% poorer. However, the claim is not entirely false, as the median American worker did experience a decline in purchasing power, albeit not as severe as the 7% claimed.\n\nTherefore, I find the claim to be HALF-TRUE, as it presents a partial truth that oversimplifies the complex relationship between inflation and wages."

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present the argument that, indeed, in 2022, illegal immigrants will have more freedoms and easier access to healthcare and ballot boxes than most Americans. \n\nFirstly, let's address the claim that illegal immigrants will have easier access to healthcare. According to Anne Dunkelberg, associate director at Every Texan, unauthorized immigrants are barred from federal health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. However, there is an exception where providers can recoup the cost of treating an unauthorized immigrant in an emergency situation. This means that hospital emergency rooms cannot turn away people with real emergencies, regardless of their immigration status. This provision ensures that unauthorized immigrants have access to emergency healthcare services, which is a crucial aspect of healthcare.\n\nFurthermore, unauthorized immigrants have access to some state and local health programs, which can be funded by federal grants. These programs address specific aspects of wellbeing, such as mental health, immunizations, and communicable disease. Although these programs are not comprehensive healthcare coverage, they do provide some level of healthcare access to unauthorized immigrants.\n\nNow, let's move on to the claim that illegal immigrants will have more freedoms and easier access to ballot boxes.

My opponent may try to dispute this claim, but I'll rely on credible evidence from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to support my position.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the raw numbers. According to the BEA, Virginia's gross domestic product (GDP) grew from $458 billion at the start of 2014 to $596 billion at the end of September 2021. This represents a total growth of 30.1% over the eight-year period. However, when we adjust for inflation, the picture changes. Measured in 2012 dollars, Virginia's GDP rose from $445 billion to $494 billion, resulting in an adjusted annual growth rate of approximately 1.3%. This is remarkably close to the \"less than 1% per year\" mentioned by Governor Youngkin.\n\nFurthermore, Virginia's inflation-adjusted growth rate of 1.3% puts it at 27th among all states, according to the BEA. This ranking is not exactly impressive, especially when compared to neighboring states like Tennessee, which had an average annual GDP growth rate of 2.1%, and North Carolina, which had a rate of 1.9%.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence from the BEA supports the claim that Virginia's economic growth has indeed",

This rate is the result of compounding, which means that the growth rate is not constant over the period.

A more comprehensive view of the economy would include these factors, which would likely paint a more positive picture of Virginia's economic performance.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's comparison of Virginia's growth rate to neighboring states is also problematic.

The evidence presented clearly demonstrates that while the state's GDP has grown, the growth rate has been stagnant, averaging only 1.3% annually when adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis shows that Virginia's GDP grew from $458 billion to $596 billion between 2014 and 2021, which may seem impressive at first glance. However, when we adjust for inflation, the picture changes. The growth rate in inflation-adjusted dollars is a more accurate representation of the state's economic performance, and it reveals a much slower pace of growth.\n\nFurthermore, Virginia's ranking among states in inflation-adjusted growth is a sobering reminder of the state's economic stagnation. With a growth rate of 1.3%, Virginia ranks 27th among all states, and is even outpaced by neighboring states like Tennessee and North Carolina.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence is clear: Virginia's economic growth has indeed stalled at less than 1% per year for eight years. This is not a claim made by a single individual, but rather a fact supported by the data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Virginia's gross domestic product grew from $458 billion to $596 billion over the period of 2014 to 2021, averaging 3.3% growth each year. When measured in inflation-adjusted dollars, Virginia's GDP rose from $445 billion to $494 billion, resulting in an adjusted annual growth rate of about 1.3%. This is not a stagnant economy, but rather a steady and moderate growth rate.\n\nFurthermore, Virginia's ranking among states in inflation-adjusted growth is not as poor as the claim suggests. The state ranked 27th among all states, and its growth rate is comparable to that of neighboring states such as Tennessee and North Carolina.\n\nIn conclusion, while Virginia's economic growth may not be as rapid as some other states, it is not accurate to claim that it has stalled at less than 1% per year for eight years. The evidence suggests a more nuanced picture of steady and moderate growth, and I urge the audience to consider the full range of data before accepting this claim as true.",
    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Virginia's economic growth has stalled at less than 1% per year for eight years is partially supported by the evidence. While the state's inflation-adjusted GDP growth rate is around 1.3%, which is close to the claimed rate, the overall growth rate is not as low as 1% per year. The evidence also shows that Virginia's GDP grew from $458 billion to $596 billion over the period, which is a significant increase. However, the growth rate has slowed down over the years, and the state's ranking among states in inflation-adjusted growth is not impressive. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is partially supported by the evidence but also oversimplifies the complexity of Virginia's economic growth."

This report was based on FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) data, which collects law enforcement data from various city, university and college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe report also notes that in 2010, there were 889,133 marijuana arrests, which is 300,000 more than arrests for all violent crimes combined. This staggering number highlights the severity of the issue and the need for a reevaluation of marijuana laws.\n\nMoreover, the ACLU's report also found that black people are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana laws than white people, which is a clear indication of racial disparities in the enforcement of these laws.\n\nFurthermore, the report states that states waste $3.7 billion enforcing marijuana laws every year, which is a significant waste of resources that could be better spent on more pressing issues.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim \"Every 37 seconds, someone is arrested for possession of marijuana\" is supported by the ACLU's report and FBI UCR data, which shows that in 2010, there were 889,133 marijuana arrests, or one every 37 seconds.

However, this figure is misleading because it includes arrests for crimes beyond just possession, such as dealing. Moreover, the report itself notes that the data is based on FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) data, which has limitations, including voluntary participation and varying definitions of crimes among local jurisdictions.\n\nFurthermore, the ACLU's own updated report in 2020 shows that there were 6.1 million marijuana-related arrests between 2010 and 2018, which translates to an arrest every 46.56 seconds.

The TikTok user who made this claim is not alone in their observation. The Hebrew script is indeed somewhat ambiguous with respect to the pronunciation of vowels, which can lead to different interpretations. This is supported by Lily Kahn, a professor of Hebrew and Jewish languages at University College London, who notes that the same consonant can be pronounced as \"b\" or \"v\" depending on the word.\n\nFurthermore, the Hebrew word \"dibbuk\" (\u05d3\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e7) is a well-documented term in Jewish folklore, referring to an evil spirit that enters into a living person or possesses them. This is confirmed by the Jewish Virtual Library encyclopedia. It's reasonable to assume that the word \"divoc\" (COVID spelled backward) could be related to this concept, given the similarity in spelling.\n\nAdditionally, Ghil'ad Zuckermann, a professor of linguistics at the University of Adelaide, Australia, has provided a visual representation of the Hebrew words \"\u05e7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d3\" (COVID) and \"\u05d3\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e7\" (dybbuk), which shows a striking resemblance.

According to the Jewish Virtual Library encyclopedia, the correct Hebrew word for an evil spirit that enters into a living person is \"dibbuk\" or \"dybbuk\", not \"divoc\". This alone discredits the claim.\n\nSecondly, even if we were to assume that \"divoc\" was a Hebrew word, the claim still lacks credibility. The professor of Hebrew and Jewish languages at University College London, Lily Kahn, explicitly states that the two words are \"definitely not the same\". This expert opinion from a reputable source further undermines the claim.\n\nLastly, the claim relies on a flawed understanding of the Hebrew script.

However, this is a narrow and limiting view of the Hebrew language. Hebrew is a complex and nuanced language with a rich history and cultural significance. It is possible that the word \"divoc\" is a lesser-known or archaic term that is not widely used in modern Hebrew, but still has a valid meaning.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument ignores the fact that the claim is based on a specific interpretation of the Hebrew script. The professor of linguistics at the University of Adelaide, Ghil'ad Zuckermann, provides an example of how the Hebrew script can be ambiguous with respect to vowel pronunciation, which suggests that it is possible to interpret the letters \"D-I-V-O-C\" as \"divoc\" in Hebrew.

This is a crucial finding that supports the claim.\n\nAccording to the study, researchers looked at infection and hospitalization rates among four groups of people in New York and California and found that those with natural immunity were better protected.

There is no clear evidence that Babbitt was fighting to halt the mob or that the attack was a false flag spurred on by antifa. The insurrection was carried out by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, many of whom were whipped up by his false claims of a stolen election. The officer who fired the bullet that killed Babbitt, Lt. Michael Byrd, was cleared of wrongdoing in two investigations. Furthermore, multiple rioters who were present during the event have denied the antifa rumors themselves in social media posts and messages. PolitiFact has also rated the claim that antifa provoked Babbitt's shooting as Pants on Fire, one of the many falsehoods about the Jan. 6 attack that merited PolitiFact's 2021 Lie of the Year designation."

The ad by DeSantis' campaign takes clips of Dr. Fauci's statements out of context, omitting crucial information and caveats that provide a more nuanced understanding of his guidance. For instance, the ad shows a clip where Dr. Fauci says \"People should not be walking around with masks\" without providing the context that this was said in March 2020, when there was a concern about a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare providers. At the time, officials didn't know that the virus could be transmitted by asymptomatic people.\n\nFurthermore, the ad selectively edits out key words and phrases, giving viewers a misleading impression about what Dr. Fauci actually said. For example, the ad shows a clip where Dr. Fauci says \"Masks work,\" but omits the rest of his statement, which includes the caveat that masks aren't 100% effective and that physical separation is also important.\n\nMoreover, the ad presents Dr. Fauci's statements as contradictory, when in reality, his guidance evolved as new data became available.

The article shows that Dr. Fauci's initial statement that \"people should not be walking around with masks\" was made in March 2020, when there was a concern about a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare providers. At that time, officials did not know that the virus could be transmitted by asymptomatic people. Later, as more was learned about the virus, Dr. Fauci's guidance changed to recommend wearing masks in public.\n\nSecondly, the claim that Dr. Fauci \"flip-flopped\" on whether kids should be in school is also misleading. The article shows that Dr. Fauci's statements were always context-dependent and based on the local situation. In September 2020, he cautioned against bringing children back to school too soon in communities with high infection rates, but in November 2020, he emphasized the importance of keeping children in school, provided that the community level of spread was low.\n\nThirdly, the claim that Dr. Fauci \"flip-flopped",

While it is true that there was a shortage of PPE at the time, Dr. Fauci's statement was not limited to this context. He also stated that masks were not necessary for the general public, and that people should not be walking around with masks. This statement was not based on any scientific evidence, and it was inconsistent with the guidance provided by other health experts at the time.\n\nSecondly, the claim that Dr. Fauci's guidance on whether kids should be in school was context-dependent and based on the local situation is also misleading.

He also initially said that kids should not be in school, but later changed his stance to say that kids should be in school. These changes in guidance are not just a result of new data becoming available, but rather a result of Dr. Fauci's own changing opinions and biases.\n\nFurthermore, the ad by DeSantis' campaign is not just presenting Dr. Fauci's statements out of context, but is also highlighting the inconsistencies in his guidance.

However, the crucial point to note is that Dr. Walensky also mentioned that the overwhelming number of deaths, over 75%, occurred in people who had at least four comorbidities.\n\nThis statement is not a false claim, as it is based on a study of 1.2 million fully vaccinated people, which is a significant sample size. The fact that 75% of deaths occurred in people with at least four comorbidities suggests that these individuals were already in a vulnerable state before contracting COVID-19, making it more likely that they would experience severe outcomes.\n\nIt's essential to note that this claim is not about the pandemic being caused by the unvaccinated, but rather about the reality that a significant proportion of COVID-19 deaths involve people with pre-existing health conditions.

However, this study did not find that 75% of COVID-19 deaths overall involved people with at least four comorbidities.\n\nIn fact, the CDC Director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, clarified that the study was only looking at vaccinated individuals and that the 75% figure referred to the number of deaths that occurred in people with at least four comorbidities within that specific group, not the overall population. This is evident from the full quote provided, where Dr. Walensky states, \"The overwhelming number of deaths \u2014 over 75% \u2014 occurred in people who had at least four comorbidities, so really these are people who were unwell to begin with.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim that the CDC said 75% of COVID-19 deaths have involved people with at least four comorbidities is misleading and inaccurate.

However, the evidence shows that the funding was already allocated and the bill was signed into law on November 15, 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that Hinson's opposition to the bill was based on her concerns about the bill's social spending provisions, not the infrastructure funding itself.

Subsequently, Governor Kathy Hochul confirmed that New York state parks had indeed hit record-high attendance levels in 2021, breaking the record set in 2020.\n\nThe evidence shows that in 2021, New York state parks had more than 78.4 million visitors, an increase of just over 427,000 from the 2020 level of just over 78 million. This increase is significant, considering that the state has not seen an annual decrease in park attendance since 2013.\n\nIt's also important to note that the annual increases during the pandemic were smaller than the increases prior to the pandemic.

According to the evidence, park attendance has been increasing consistently since 2013, with annual increases ranging from 2.6 million to 2.9 million visitors. This trend predates the pandemic, and it's unclear how much of the increase in 2021 can be attributed to the pandemic.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that the annual increases during the pandemic were smaller than those prior to the pandemic. For instance, between 2018 and 2019, attendance increased by over 2.9 million visitors, whereas between 2020 and 2021, it increased by only about 427,000 visitors. This suggests that the pandemic may not have had a significant impact on park attendance.\n\nLastly, the claim ignores the measures taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19, which likely had a significant impact on park attendance.

The pandemic brought about unprecedented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and capacity limits.

The evidence supports this claim.\n\nIn 2020, Iowa saw a record-high turnout of 1.7 million voters, with over 1 million voting by absentee ballot. This is a significant increase from previous years.

The pandemic led to increased absentee voting, which may have artificially inflated turnout. In fact, the evidence states that election officials sent absentee ballot request forms to every active registered voter in Iowa, which likely contributed to the record-high turnout.

The pandemic created an unprecedented situation that likely drove up voter turnout, and it is unfair to attribute this increase solely to the voting laws implemented by the state.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument relies heavily on comparing the 2020 election to the 2018 and 2019 off-year elections, which is not a fair comparison. The 2020 election was a presidential election, which typically draws more voters than off-year elections. In fact, the national average for early voting in person is 23 days, and Iowa's 2020 election allowed for 29 days of early voting, which is longer than the national average. This increased access to voting likely contributed to the higher turnout.\n\nAdditionally, the opponent's argument does not account for the potential negative impact of voter ID laws on voter participation.

The Build Back Better bill is a comprehensive piece of legislation with far-reaching implications for the country. It's reasonable to expect that a candidate running for public office would have a clear understanding of the bill's contents. Finkenauer's admission that she doesn't know what's in the bill raises serious questions about her ability to effectively represent her constituents and make informed decisions on their behalf.\n\nFurthermore, Finkenauer's subsequent comments in the video clip do not contradict her initial statement.

This lack of awareness from multiple government agencies suggests that the claim is likely unfounded.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that the number of people crossing the southern U.S. border has increased significantly over the past decade, and many migrants attempt to stay in the U.S. by seeking asylum, which is their right under federal law. The government has a legal process in place to relocate these migrants throughout the country, including to North Carolina. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this relocation process involves secret drops at 3am in big box retail locations.\n\nThirdly, the evidence suggests that the claim is similar to other rumors spread in conservative media about \"ghost flights\" transporting immigrants \"in the middle of the night,\" which have not been substantiated.

While it's true that the claim is based on a tweet by a candidate for a U.S. House seat, Tyler Lee, and that some government agencies have denied any knowledge of immigrants being dropped off in Huntersville, I believe the opponent's argument is flawed for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, the opponent's reliance on the Fox News report is problematic. Fox News has a history of spreading misinformation and sensationalized reporting, which can be misleading and biased. Moreover, the report itself does not provide any concrete evidence to support the claim that ICE is releasing immigrants in Huntersville at big box retail locations.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument that the government agencies' denials do not necessarily mean the claim is false is a weak one. If the claim were true, it's likely that the government agencies would be aware of it, especially if it's happening in a public area like a big box retail location. The fact that multiple agencies have denied any knowledge of such activity suggests that the claim is likely false.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's hypothetical scenario about the federal government relocating people to Huntersville is not relevant to the claim. The claim specifically states that ICE is releasing immigrants in Huntersville at big box retail locations, which is a different scenario altogether.\n\nFinally, I'd like to point out that the article itself mentions that the number of people crossing the southern U.S. border has skyrocketed over the past decade, and that many",

Additionally, the fact that local authorities are unaware of any such activities doesn't necessarily mean they're not happening. It's possible that the drop-offs are being carried out in a way that's not publicly disclosed or reported.\n\nFurthermore, we have to consider the credibility of the source making the claim. Tyler Lee, the candidate for U.S. House seat, is a credible source, and his claim is supported by a Fox News reporter's tweet. While some may question the credibility of Fox News, it's still a reputable news organization that has a track record of reporting on immigration issues.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be no concrete evidence to support the claim, I believe it's premature to dismiss it as false.

While it is true that embalmers have reported noticing an increase in unusual blood clots among the deceased, the claim that these clots are specifically caused by the COVID-19 vaccines is not supported by the evidence. The experts consulted by PolitiFact, including hematologists and funeral directors, have explained that the observed blood clots are likely a result of COVID-19 infection itself, rather than the vaccines. However, the claim is not entirely false, as embalmers have indeed reported noticing an increase in unusual blood clots among the deceased, which may be related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the verdict is HALF-TRUE."

This statement is not only made by a credible source but is also backed by historical data.\n\nAs the evidence shows, Clarence Thomas was nominated by President George H.W.

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present the argument that the proposed changes to the Electoral Count Act show that Vice President Mike Pence had the power to \"overturn the election\" and could have done so.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand the context of the situation. On January 6, 2021, former President Donald Trump believed that his last hope to reverse his election defeat lay with Vice President Mike Pence. Trump's team argued that Pence could set aside the electoral votes from certain states, including Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, to erase Joe Biden's winning margin.\n\nThe evidence suggests that Trump's team was correct in their assertion. The Electoral Count Act, a 100-year-old law, does provide a mechanism for the Vice President to set aside electoral votes in certain circumstances. Specifically, the law states that if there is more than one slate of electors coming from official bodies in a given state, the Senate and House would each vote on who the lawful electors are. If the Senate and House disagreed, then the slate certified by the state's executive would be counted.\n\nIn this situation, Trump's team argued that the text gives the option for none of the votes to be counted in that circumstance. This provision was the opening Trump hoped to use to derail the certification of Biden's win and usurp the presidency.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence shows that Pence did have the power to set aside the electoral votes.

The law does not provide a mechanism for the Vice President to set aside electoral votes unilaterally. Instead, it provides a process for resolving disputes between the Senate and House over which slate of electors is lawful.

This is a verifiable fact, supported by the evidence provided.\n\nThe court's ruling did not, however, invalidate the votes cast in the 2020 presidential election.

This is evident from the fact that the judges wrote that \"no-excuse mail-in voting makes the exercise of the franchise more convenient\" and that if presented to the people, it is \"likely to be adopted.\" This suggests that the court's ruling does not necessarily mean that mail-in voting is unconstitutional, but rather that the law that allowed it was invalid.\n\nThirdly, the court's ruling did not affect the outcome of the election, which was certified by the state and accepted by Congress. Biden still won Pennsylvania by about 80,000 votes, and the court's ruling did not change the outcome of the election.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that \"Pennsylvania had 2.6 million mail-in votes that the court of appeals of PA held to be unconstitutional.

Now, I know this might seem counterintuitive, but bear with me as I present the evidence.\n\nFirstly, Whoopi Goldberg, a prominent figure, made a statement that sparked a heated debate. She said, \"If you're going to do this, then let's be truthful about it, because the Holocaust isn't about race. No, it's not about race.\" While some people disagreed with her, I believe she raises a valid point.\n\nThe evidence suggests that the Holocaust was not solely about race. According to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, \"Racism was central to Nazi ideology.\" However, the museum also emphasizes that \"Jews were not defined by religion, but by race.\" This implies that the Nazis' perception of Jews as a race was a crucial factor in their persecution.\n\nMoreover, the Auschwitz Memorial tweeted that the Holocaust was about the Nazi's systematic annihilation of the Jewish people, who they deemed to be an inferior race. This statement highlights the role of racism in the Holocaust, but it also acknowledges that the Nazis' perception of Jews as a race was a key factor.\n\nHistorians like Benjamin Hett and Peter Hayes have also shed light on the Nazi ideology.

This racist ideology was deeply ingrained in the Nazi worldview, and it was used to justify the brutal treatment and murder of Jews. The Nazis believed that Jews were \"implacably and by inheritance different and hostile\" and therefore had to be \"removed\" (Peter Hayes).\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that the Nazis developed a hierarchical system of races, with Aryans at the top and Jews at the bottom. This racial hierarchy was used to justify the persecution and murder of Jews, as well as other groups deemed to be inferior, such as Romani people, disabled individuals, and LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nThirdly, the evidence highlights that Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazi party, saw Jewish people as \"subhuman\" entities who threatened all other races.

A video posted by Bob Saget on YouTube in October 2021, featuring a conversation with his wife Kelly Rizzo, shows Saget stating, \"So I don't have long to live, if these are your favorites. I'm going to be found dead in bed.\" This statement, made months before his actual death, is a chilling prediction that cannot be ignored.\n\nThe timing of the video's release, combined with the content of the conversation, raises serious questions about the nature of Saget's statement. Was it simply a joke, or was it a genuine prediction? The fact that Saget's family has confirmed that his death was the result of head trauma only adds to the eerie feeling that this was more than just a coincidence.\n\nI urge you to consider the weight of this evidence and the implications it has on our understanding of Saget's death. The claim that Bob Saget predicted his own death is not just a conspiracy theory or a baseless speculation; it is a disturbing reality that demands our attention and respect.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the claim that Bob Saget predicted his own death is TRUE, and I urge you to join me in acknowledging the significance of this evidence. Thank you.",
    "con_closing": "I'm happy to summarize my final position.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the claim that Bob Saget predicted his death is HALF-TRUE. While it is true that Bob Saget made a statement in a video with his wife Kelly Rizzo, saying \"So I don't have long to live, if these are your favorites. I'm going to be found dead in bed,\" it is important to consider the context of the statement.\n\nThe video was posted in October 2021, and it is unclear what Saget meant by his statement. He may have been joking or using hyperbole to make a point, rather than making a genuine prediction about his own death. Additionally, the statement was not a direct prediction of his death, but rather a hypothetical scenario.\n\nFurthermore, the statement was not a unique or unusual thing for Saget to say. He was known for his sense of humor and often made lighthearted jokes about his own mortality. It is possible that he was simply making a humorous comment, rather than a serious prediction.\n\nIn conclusion, while the statement may seem ominous in hindsight, it is important to consider the context and tone of the statement, as well as Saget's personality and sense of humor. Therefore, I believe that the claim that Bob Saget predicted his death is HALF-TRUE, as it is based on a statement that may have been meant as a joke or a hypothetical scenario rather than a genuine prediction.",
    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: TRUE\nREASON: The evidence presented, including the video clip and the timing of its posting, suggests that Bob Saget did indeed predict his own death. While the statement may have been made in a lighthearted or humorous tone, the specificity of the prediction and the fact that it was made months before his actual death make it difficult to dismiss as a mere coincidence. The claim is supported by the evidence and is therefore TRUE."

According to the evidence, the Heritage Foundation's scorecard ranked Nevada 50th, ahead of only Hawaii, in their state-by-state election integrity scorecard. This ranking is based on their views of state election laws, which prioritize stricter voting rules, such as photo ID requirements, and oppose expansive voting by mail.\n\nIt's essential to note that the Heritage Foundation's methodology is not without controversy.

For instance, the scorecard does not evaluate states' post-election audits or the use of voter-verified paper ballots, which are considered essential for maintaining the security and accuracy of elections.\n\nMoreover, the Heritage Foundation's criticisms of Nevada's election laws are based on their own subjective views. For example, they deduct points from Nevada for having unattended, unsecure drop boxes, despite the state's law requiring them to be secure, locked, and made of metal.

The CDC data also provides information on the percentage of people who are fully vaccinated and those who have received booster shots. If we consider these additional metrics, the picture changes. For example, according to the CDC data, Minnesota has a higher percentage of fully vaccinated individuals than Illinois.\n\nThirdly, the claim is not entirely accurate even when considering the percentage of people who have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The data shows that South Dakota and Minnesota have vaccination rates that are very close to Illinois', with only a 1.6% difference.

    "pro_closing": "Thank you, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters. As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the claim \"A larger percentage of Illinoisans have been vaccinated than in any other Midwestern state\" is indeed TRUE.\n\nThroughout this debate, we've presented evidence from credible sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) vaccination data tracker. The data clearly shows that as of February 2nd, 75.6% of Illinoisans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, surpassing the nearest Midwestern states, South Dakota and Minnesota, with 74% and 73.6%, respectively.\n\nGovernor J.B. Pritzker's statement, as well as his administration's clarification, confirms that Illinois leads the Midwest in vaccinations. The distinction between fully vaccinated and those who have received at least one dose is crucial, as it highlights the state's efforts to prioritize vaccination and combat the pandemic.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the claim that Illinois has the highest vaccination rate among Midwestern states. I urge you to consider the facts and acknowledge that Illinois is indeed a leader in vaccination efforts, making it a safer and healthier place for its residents. Thank you.",

The claim that \"A larger percentage of Illinoisans have been vaccinated than in any other Midwestern state\" is only accurate when considering the percentage of people who have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. However, this is a narrow definition that does not account for the entire Midwest region.\n\nWhen looking at the broader definition of vaccination rates, including those who are fully vaccinated and those who have received a booster shot, Illinois does not necessarily lead the Midwest. In fact, other states like Minnesota and South Dakota have higher vaccination rates in these categories.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is also misleading because it does not provide context about the vaccination rates in the entire Midwest region, which includes 12 states. By only comparing Illinois to its neighboring states, the claim creates a false narrative that Illinois is the vaccination leader in the Midwest.\n\nIn conclusion, while Illinois may have a higher percentage of people who have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, the claim that \"A larger percentage of Illinoisans have been vaccinated than in any other Midwestern state\" is incomplete and misleading. It is essential to consider the broader definition of vaccination rates and the entire Midwest region to accurately assess the vaccination efforts in Illinois.

The claim only considers a narrow definition of vaccination rates and does not account for the entire Midwest region, which includes 12 states.

This study examined the impact of waiting periods in the United States from 1970 to 2014 and found that states with waiting periods avoided around 750 homicides per year.\n\nFurthermore, the same researchers also noted that intense emotions like anger and sadness can cause people to take actions they later regret, such as resorting to gun violence. They suggested that inserting even a short delay in the gun-buying process has the potential to reduce gun violence, without restricting anyone's right to own a gun.\n\nAdditionally, a Wisconsin-focused study published in 2021 found that the repeal of the waiting period in Wisconsin correlated with an increase in firearm-related suicides among Wisconsin residents of color and those residing in urban counties. This suggests that the lack of a waiting period can have a disproportionate impact on certain communities.\n\nWhile some may argue that a waiting period does not by itself stop a crime, particularly if a gun is bought \"off the black market,\" I would counter that the waiting period can still have a deterrent effect on impulsive decisions. It gives individuals time to cool off and reconsider their actions, which can ultimately lead to safer communities.\n\nIn conclusion",

However, this study has been criticized for its methodology and limitations. For example, the study did not control for other factors that could influence crime rates, such as changes in policing strategies or socioeconomic conditions.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that waiting periods do not address the root causes of crime, such as poverty, lack of education, and social inequality. Crime is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach, and waiting periods are not a panacea.\n\nThirdly, the claim is misleading because it implies that waiting periods are a foolproof way to prevent crimes of passion. However, as Thomas Leager pointed out, a waiting period does not guarantee that a crime will not occur. In fact, a waiting period could even be counterproductive if it prevents a person from getting a gun in time to protect themselves.\n\nFinally, the claim is misleading because it ignores the existence of the black market.

Additionally, the study did not control for other factors that may have contributed to the reduction in firearm homicides, such as changes in gun laws, demographics, or socioeconomic factors.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's reliance on the Harvard Business School study is misplaced. The study's authors themselves noted that the relationship between waiting periods and firearm homicides is complex and may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of waiting period, the length of the waiting period, and the characteristics of the individuals purchasing the firearms.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument that intense emotions like anger and sadness can cause people to take actions they later regret is anecdotal and lacks empirical evidence.

The claim is misleading because it does not provide the full context of the data and presents a skewed view of the situation.\n\nFirstly, the claim only focuses on the number of encounters, which is not a reliable indicator of the number of unique individuals attempting to cross the border. According to the evidence, a large number of expulsions during the coronavirus pandemic have contributed to a higher number of migrants making multiple border crossing attempts. This means that the 518k encounters may not represent 518k unique individuals, but rather a significant number of repeat attempts by the same individuals.\n\nSecondly, the claim does not account for the fact that the number of expulsions has increased due to the requirement for non-U.S. citizens to show proof of vaccination.

This surge is not a one-time anomaly, as the numbers have continued to grow, with 672,838 encounters reported through January.\n\nIt's essential to note that this increase is not solely attributed to the Biden Administration, as Senator Grassley correctly pointed out.

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to argue that the claim \"Teachers can only deduct up to $250 for school supplies on their taxes, but billionaires can write off the entire cost of a private jet\" is TRUE.\n\nFirstly, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), teachers are allowed to deduct up to $250 for school supplies they purchase out-of-pocket for use in the classroom, even if they don't itemize deductions. This is a fact that is supported by the IRS's own guidelines.\n\nOn the other hand, billionaires can write off the entire cost of a private jet, as long as it is used predominantly for business purposes. According to Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, the cost of purchasing a private plane can be deducted by a business that owns the plane. This is because the plane is considered a physical asset with a useful life of 20 years or less, and can be deducted in the year of acquisition.\n\nFurthermore, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 allows businesses to deduct the full cost of a private aircraft, as long as it is used predominantly for business purposes. This means that billionaires can write off the entire cost of a private jet, while teachers are limited to a mere $250 deduction for school supplies.\n\nIt's worth noting that the rules for deducting private aircraft are complex and strict, and require the plane to be used predominantly for business purposes.

According to the evidence, teachers are allowed to deduct up to $250 for supplies they purchase out-of-pocket for use in the classroom, even if they don't itemize deductions. However, this limit increases to $300 in the 2022 tax year. This means that teachers can deduct more than $250 for school supplies, contrary to the claim.\n\nSecondly, the claim compares apples and oranges by comparing the deduction for school supplies with the deduction for a private jet. The deduction for a private jet is not a fixed amount, but rather the full cost of the aircraft, which can be deducted by a business that owns the plane. The evidence states that the cost of purchasing a private plane can be deducted by a business that owns the plane, and the deduction is subject to certain rules and regulations.\n\nFurthermore, the claim implies that billionaires can write off the entire cost of a private jet without any restrictions, which is not accurate.

On the other hand, billionaires can deduct the full cost of a private jet, as long as it is used predominantly for business purposes. This disparity is a stark example of the inequity in the tax code, where those who can afford private jets are given more favorable treatment than those who are working hard to educate our children.\n\nThe tweet from Melanie D'Arrigo, a New York congressional candidate, highlights this issue, garnering widespread attention and support. The facts are clear: teachers are limited in their deductions, while billionaires have more flexibility and benefits. This is not only unfair but also perpetuates the wealth gap in our society.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is TRUE, and it's essential that we address this issue to create a more equitable tax system.

The reality is that the tax code allows businesses, including those owned by billionaires, to deduct the full cost of a private aircraft if it's used predominantly for business purposes. This is not a special privilege reserved only for billionaires, but rather a standard business expense deduction.\n\nThe claim also ignores the fact that the tax code has strict rules and regulations in place to ensure that the deduction is only available for legitimate business use, and not for personal use. For example, the aircraft must be used predominantly for business purposes, and there are penalties and recapture provisions if the requirements are not met.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is also misleading in that it implies that billionaires are getting a special break that teachers are not. However, teachers are able to deduct the cost of school supplies, which is a legitimate business expense for them. The difference is that the tax code recognizes that teachers are not businesses, and therefore, they are not entitled to the same deductions as businesses.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim may be attention-grabbing, it is fundamentally misleading and inaccurate.

Senators like Susan Collins, Chuck Grassley, Bill Cassidy, and John Kennedy have all shown willingness to address the issue. Additionally, former President Donald Trump's 2020 deal allowed Medicare recipients to choose plans with capped insulin costs at $35.\n\nMoreover, the fact that all 50 Republicans in the Senate opposed the Build Back Better Act does not necessarily mean they are opposed to capping insulin prices. The opposition was likely due to the broader scope of the bill, not the specific provision on insulin prices.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Facebook post may have oversimplified the situation, the evidence suggests that Biden and most Democrats do want to cap insulin prices at $35 per month, and while not all Republicans are opposed to it, the majority of them in the Senate did vote against the Build Back Better Act.

According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Eric Schmitt proposed a bill in 2011 that would have offered up to $480 million worth of tax breaks over 15 years to spur foreign trade through Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. This bill was specifically aimed at creating a cargo hub for airlines, including China Cargo Airlines, which is owned by China's Communist Party.\n\nThe bill, as reported by the St. Louis Beacon, would have provided $420 million in incentives to build warehouses and distribution centers within a 50-mile radius of Lambert Airport, and $60 million in tax credits for companies shipping exports out of Missouri. This would have allowed China Cargo Airlines to flood Missouri markets with cheap Chinese imports, as claimed by the super PAC ad.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence shows that Schmitt's bill was not just about creating a cargo hub, but also about handling exports.

Moreover, the bill was not signed into law, and the project was ultimately scrapped.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that the airline was \"owned by China's Communist Party\" is also misleading. While it is true that China Eastern Airlines, the parent company of China Cargo Airlines, was majority-owned by the Chinese government, the evidence does not show that China Cargo Airlines itself was owned by the Communist Party. The SEC filing cited by the super PAC ad only indicates that the Chinese government had an indirect stake in China Cargo through its ownership of China Eastern.\n\nAdditionally, the claim that Schmitt \"voted to let China buy up Missouri farmland\" is also misleading.

This is a significant amount of money that could have been used for other purposes, and it is reasonable to question whether the benefits of the project outweighed the costs.\n\nRegarding the claim that the airline was \"owned by China's Communist Party,\" my opponent is splitting hairs.

This is a significant point, as it raises concerns about the potential for Chinese government influence and control over the airline.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument that the 2013 state law allowing foreign ownership of agricultural land in Missouri did not specifically allow China to buy up Missouri farmland is misleading. The law did loosen the prohibition on foreign ownership of agricultural land, and it is reasonable to assume that this change would have allowed Chinese companies to purchase Missouri farmland.

Mark Finchem, who has endorsed by former President Donald Trump. This suggests that the claim is not just a random or isolated idea, but rather a serious proposal that has been endorsed by a prominent figure.\n\nSecondly, the article quotes Finchem as saying that the resolution is not about \"decertifying\" the results, but rather about providing a \"remedy for outcome-determinative fraud and illegality in the conduct of the election.\" This suggests that the claim is not about overturning the results of the election, but rather about addressing any potential irregularities or fraud that may have occurred during the election.\n\nThirdly, the article notes that the resolution calls for setting aside the results in Pima, Maricopa, and Yuma counties because Finchem believes that the election there was \"irredeemably flawed.\" This suggests that the claim is not just about overturning the results of the election, but rather about ensuring that the election was conducted fairly and accurately.\n\nFinally, the article quotes Paul Bender, an Arizona State University law professor, who says that the Legislature",

While it is true that the bill has no legal merit and has been debunked by fact-checkers and elections officials, I believe that the bill is still a significant threat to the integrity of the democratic process.\n\nFirstly, the bill is not just about decertifying the election results, but also about setting aside the results in three counties in Arizona. This is a significant step that could potentially change the outcome of the election. While the bill may not have legal merit, it is still a political statement that could have real-world consequences.\n\nSecondly, the bill is not just about the past, but also about the future. It is a statement that the election was \"irredeemably flawed\" and that the results are not legitimate. This could have a chilling effect on future elections, as it could lead to further challenges to the legitimacy of the democratic process.\n\nThirdly, the bill is not just about the election results, but also about the power of the state legislature. The bill is an attempt to assert the power of the legislature to override the will of the people and to determine the outcome of the election. This is a significant threat to the democratic process, as it could lead to further erosion of the power of the people and the legitimacy of the democratic process.\n\nIn conclusion, while the bill may not have legal merit,",

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the Arizona House bill to \"decertify\" the 2020 election results is a misguided and legally unsound attempt to undermine the democratic process.\n\nAs we've discussed, the bill has no legal merit and is not going anywhere. The resolution is based on debunked claims of voter fraud and allegations of fraud and probable cause of criminal wrongdoing that have been dismissed by investigations and fact-checkers. Moreover, the bill's author, State Rep. Mark Finchem, acknowledges that there is no process under current law to decertify the election, but claims that the Legislature can \"provide a remedy for outcome-determinative fraud and illegality in the conduct of the election.\" This argument is not legally sound and has been rejected by election law experts.\n\nFurthermore, the electors have already cast their ballots for Biden on December 14, 2020, and Congress accepted the results on January 6, 2021. The Legislature cannot disregard the results of the votes cast by electors, as stated by Paul Bender, an Arizona State University law professor.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge everyone to ignore claims from anyone about the prospect of undoing the 2020 results, as they are baseless and harmful to the democratic process. We must focus on moving forward and promoting transparency and accountability in our elections, rather than perpetuating misinformation and conspiracy theories. Thank you.",

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to argue that the claim \"Greg Casar passed paid sick leave\" is TRUE. \n\nAs evidence, I'd like to highlight the following points:\n\nFirstly, according to the evidence, Greg Casar did indeed lead a successful effort to pass Austin's paid sick leave ordinance while he was a member of the Austin City Council. This is stated in the TV ad shared on Twitter, which says \"Greg Casar \u2014 passed paid sick leave\" and references his time on the council.\n\nSecondly, the ordinance was approved by the city council in February 2018, which is a clear indication that Casar's efforts were successful in passing the legislation.\n\nHowever, I'd like to acknowledge that the ordinance never took effect due to legal challenges and was ultimately struck down by the Texas Supreme Court. This does not negate the fact that Casar did pass the ordinance, but rather highlights the challenges that followed.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that Casar did sponsor a resolution that provided paid sick leave to part-time, temporary, and seasonal city employees, which was adopted in March 2018. This further supports the claim that Casar has a track record of advocating for paid sick leave.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paid sick leave ordinance may not have taken effect, the fact remains that Greg Casar did pass the legislation, and his efforts to provide paid sick leave to city employees were successful. Therefore, I argue that the claim \"Greg Casar passed paid sick leave\" is TRUE",
    "con_opening": "I'm happy to present my opening argument.\n\nThe claim that \"Greg Casar passed paid sick leave\" is FALSE and misleading. While it is true that Casar was a member of the Austin City Council and led an effort to pass a paid sick leave ordinance, the ordinance never took effect. The evidence shows that the ordinance was approved by the city council in February 2018, but it was later struck down by the courts in June 2020.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is misleading because it implies that Casar successfully passed a paid sick leave policy that was implemented and benefited employees. However, the reality is that the policy was never implemented and did not provide any benefits to employees. The only benefit that was provided was to part-time, temporary, and seasonal city employees, which was a separate resolution adopted in March 2018.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that \"Greg Casar passed paid sick leave\" is false and misleading because it omits crucial information about the outcome of the ordinance and the fact that it was never implemented. It is important to be accurate and transparent when making claims about one's accomplishments, and Casar's ad falls short of this standard.",

While it is true that the paid sick leave ordinance was struck down by the courts, it is important to recognize that Casar's efforts to pass the ordinance were a significant achievement in and of themselves.\n\nFirstly, the fact that the ordinance was approved by the city council in February 2018 demonstrates that Casar was able to build a coalition of support and gather the necessary votes to pass a major piece of legislation. This is a significant accomplishment, especially considering the challenges that often come with passing progressive policies.\n\nSecondly, while the ordinance may not have taken effect, it is important to recognize that the effort to pass it helped raise awareness and spark a conversation about the importance of paid sick leave. This is an important step towards creating a more just and equitable society, and Casar's efforts in this regard are worthy of recognition.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that the claim is not misleading because it does not imply that the ordinance was implemented and benefited employees. Rather, it accurately reflects Casar's role in leading the effort to pass the ordinance, which is an important achievement in and of itself.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the claim \"Greg Casar passed paid sick leave\" is accurate and not misleading.

In this case, the ordinance was never implemented due to legal challenges, which means that it did not actually pass.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument that Casar's efforts to provide paid sick leave to part-time, temporary, and seasonal city employees are relevant to the claim is a stretch.

This is not a trivial matter; it shows that Casar is willing to take concrete actions to improve the lives of his constituents.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paid sick leave ordinance may not have taken effect, Casar's efforts to pass it and his subsequent actions to provide paid sick leave to city employees demonstrate his dedication to this issue.
