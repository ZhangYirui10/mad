Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is \"conveniently misleading.\" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions.\n\"Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Jackson said.\nLooking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%.

The U.S. stands out with a fall between those years of 970 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Japan\u2019s emissions went down 237 million metric tons. China, on the other hand, released an additional 4,689 million metric tons in 2020 than it did in 2005, while India\u2019s emissions rose 1,315 million metric tons.\nChart used by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to show carbon dioxide emission trends for nine countries. (Office of Dan Sullivan)\nSullivan\u2019s staff pulled these numbers from the website Our World in Data, a reliable resource based at the University of Oxford in England. The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019.\nThe first caveat to Sullivan\u2019s approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is \"conveniently misleading.\" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions.\n\"Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Jackson said.\nLooking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%."

      "COVID-19 is not seasonal, spreads more easily and is far deadlier than the flu.",

      "\"As data from serological surveys is compiled, this estimate will continue to evolve, including adjustments for new developments such as increasing numbers of people vaccinated,\" the WHO said in a statement emailed by a spokesperson. \"Irrespective of the precise estimate, COVID-19 remains a dangerous and deadly infectious disease, claiming thousands of lives each day.\"",
      "\"The CDC is comparing the mortality of COVID-19 to influenza now but that was not the case at the beginning of the pandemic,\" said Dr. Monica Gandhi, a University of California, San Francisco, medical professor and an infectious disease expert. \"COVID was far deadlier than influenza until we got to widespread population immunity.\"",
      "The WHO referred us to two studies to support its statement. A study in Nature from November 2020 estimated that the COVID-19 infection rate ratio increased with age, ranging from .001% in children ages 5-9, to 8.29% in people age 80 and older. Authors said\u00a0 there are \"key unanswered questions with regard to the consistency of mortality patterns across countries.\"",
      "\"Circumstances have changed,\" Wen said, pointing to available vaccines, treatments and high population exposure to the virus, and less lethal subvariants of omicron. \"It is now clear that it's not possible for COVID to be eliminated. As a result, it is now appropriate to consider COVID in the same category of other serious respiratory pathogens such as influenza.\"",
      "In an overview of six prior studies, Dr. John P. A. Ioannidis of Stanford University found the infection fatality rate, which is the probability of dying for a person who is infected, to be around\u00a0 0.15%, though he warned that it varies widely around the world.",
      "\"The joint ISTAT-ISS reports drawn up on the basis of death certificates show that COVID-19 is the directly responsible cause of death in 89% of deaths of people positive to the SARS-CoV-2 test,\" the agency said in the release. \"In view of the fact that chronic diseases represent a risk factor for death from COVID-19 and that these are very common in the general population, it is not surprising the high frequency of these conditions in the SARS-CoV-2 positive deceased population.\"",

They are often associated with emergency care provided when patients must go to the closest medical facility and can\u2019t check the network status of the facility or emergency room physicians. They also may stem from nonemergency hospitalizations or surgeries at an in-network facility that involve a provider, such as an anesthesiologist or radiologist, who is out of network and bills separately.",

The act also protects patients from \"surprise\" bills from an out-of-network air ambulance transport. Out of network means the doctor doesn\u2019t take your medical insurance or isn\u2019t included on the list of approved providers in your insurance network.",

It made quality coverage more affordable than ever, with families saving an average of $2,400 on their annual premiums, and four out of five consumers finding quality coverage for under $10 a month. As a result, millions of our fellow Americans have now gained the security and peace of mind that dependable health insurance brings.\"",
      "\"These other forms of coverage are not subject to the $2,000 cap, although some other out-of-pocket limit may apply and implementation of the cap will indirectly tighten the requirements that apply to some retiree plans,\" said Matthew Fiedler, senior fellow in economic studies at the Center on Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank.",
      "\"There are certainly plenty of things that are surprises in the medical system,\" said Adler. \"Such as people don\u2019t realize they have a deductible, and that\u2019s a surprise. Or your insurance company denies a claim, and that\u2019s a surprise.\"",

Isn\u2019t it kind of interesting? If it\u2019s my fault, why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? I\u2019m not being a wise guy.\"",
      "A look at cross-national data shows that economic growth in the United States has indeed outpaced that of the other large, comparable economies, and experts agree that this rapid growth has been a factor in the United States\u2019 currently high inflation rate.",
      "The Federal Reserve analysis didn\u2019t blame inflation solely on government spending. It said global supply chain problems and changes in spending patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed up inflation worldwide. The study did blame higher U.S. government spending for making inflation higher in the United States than in other developed nations since the first half of 2021.",
      "However, the correlation between rapid growth and high inflation isn\u2019t perfect. Germany and Canada had the second- and third-highest inflation rates, respectively, but their economic growth barely edged into positive territory when factoring in the pandemic. And the United Kingdom and France nearly matched the U.S.\u2019s GDP growth rates but have experienced more modest inflation.",
      "However, most economists also agree that the American Rescue Plan exacerbated inflation but was not the sole cause. The supply chain shortages, economists say, ignited the inflation increase, and Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine \u2014 which prompted an oil price spike and other trade interruptions \u2014\u00a0 worsened it.",
      "Looking at the most recent monthly inflation numbers, more than a dozen OECD members had a higher inflation rate than the United States\u2019 8.6%. These were predominantly Baltic and Eastern European nations, which have been hit especially hard by the consequences of Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nBut a larger number of OECD members had inflation rates lower than 8.6%, and these include all but one member of the G-7 group, which is limited to the world\u2019s very largest democratic economies.\nAmong the G-7 nations, Germany\u2019s most recent inflation rate was 7.9%, the United Kingdom\u2019s was 7.8%, Italy\u2019s and Canada\u2019s were 6.8%, and France\u2019s was 5.2%. (The final G-7 member, Japan, hasn\u2019t released current inflation numbers.)",
      "So the United States has a higher inflation rate currently than its closest economic peers do.",
      "However, most economists also agree that the American Rescue Plan didn\u2019t alone cause inflation\u2019s rise.

      "\"What causes inflation?\" Pelosi said on May 15. \"One is when unemployment goes down, inflation goes up. That's not anything to accept. When wages go up, inflation goes up. That's one. When supply goes down, cost goes up. So supply is affected by COVID and supply chain problems that we have because of COVID, and also because of the war in Ukraine. There is a Putin price hike at the pump. Not all of it to him, but a large part of it.\"",
      "The post-COVID-19 inflation story is more complicated than just federal spending. Other forces, including changes in the labor market, rising global energy and commodity prices, supply chain dysfunction and the war in Ukraine have all contributed to higher prices.",
      "For the first half of 2022, the U.S. had the highest inflation rate of any G-7 country. But in the most recent data, covering July 2023, that has reversed: The U.S. now has the lowest inflation of any G-7 country.",
      "how the U.S. ranks internationally in inflation \u2014 in June 2022, at the height of U.S. inflation \u2014 we found that although inflation rose above pre-COVID-19 levels in every major economy around the world, inflation in the United States spiked higher than its most direct competitors.",
      "For instance, the theory\u2019s inability to explain the U.S. economy since the 1990s may have been because of strong growth in productivity, Burtless said. Productivity gains enabled workers\u2019 wages to grow even as overall costs for employers remained low. This produced the combination of relatively low unemployment and relatively low inflation. Intensifying globalization, which put competitive pressure on U.S. producers to keep price increases small,\u00a0may also have played a role."

      "On June 17, Summers told Barron\u2019s that \"when you have unemployment below 4% and inflation above 4%, recession always follows within two years.\" (Summers used the same formula in an interview with NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" two days later.)",
      "Under my plan, unemployment has been under 4% for two full years now, and inflation has been at the pre-pandemic level of 2% over the last half year.",
      "We found only one clear example of Summers\u2019 rule holding \u2014 a two-year period in 1968 and 1969 when unemployment was under 4% and inflation was above 4%. That came in the immediate run-up to a recession.",
      "For about a year in 1951, unemployment was under 4% while inflation was above 4%. But inflation then dropped to 1.1% or less for the six months immediately before a recession in 1953, so this is not unequivocal evidence for Summers\u2019 larger point about high inflation being a precursor to a recession.",
      "Currently, the unemployment rate is 3.6% and the inflation rate is 8.6%, so if Summers\u2019 rule is correct, then the U.S. should be facing a recession sometime in the next 24 months.",
      "Summers\u2019 premise \u2014 that there are a decent number of time periods when unemployment was below 4% at the same time inflation was above 4% \u2014 has problems from the start. In reality, there haven\u2019t been many such periods.",
      "Meanwhile, this is before we factor in high inflation. We cross-checked the months of sub-4% unemployment with inflation rates and found that none of the five months in 2000 also had inflation above 4%.",
      "on the social media platform X, Biden wrote, \"Experts said that to get inflation under control, we needed to drive up unemployment. We found a better way.

      "\"Yesterday, we learned the economy grew faster than expected last quarter,\" Biden said. \"And this morning, we saw data showing that last month the annual rate of inflation continued to decline. So, inflation is now at its lowest point in two years. And wages are up after being adjusted for inflation.\"",
      "Let\u2019s start by looking just at the periods when unemployment was below 4%. Since 1948, unemployment has been this low only on four general occasions.",
      "So, before mid-2018, there were a grand total of five months since 1970 in which unemployment was under 4%. That's less than 1% of the months over the past half century or so.",
      "Consider a comparison of the rates of inflation and unemployment from 2012 to the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Inflation ran in a pretty narrow range during that period, from effectively zero to 2.9%. Yet, over the same time span, unemployment ranged from 8.3% (a level rarely reached going back to 1950) all the way down to 3.5% (close to a record low).",
      "Biden\u2019s saying \"below 4%\" made his statement correct. But by setting a 50-year timeline, Biden cordons off two earlier periods in which unemployment was below 4% for much longer.",
      "Biden said, \"First of all, (a recession is) not inevitable. Secondly, we\u2019re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation. It\u2019s bad. Isn\u2019t it kind of interesting? If it\u2019s my fault, why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? I\u2019m not being a wise guy.\"",
      "For the past six months, year-over-year inflation as measured by the CPI has hovered near 3%, not 2%. Because the Federal Reserve has said it\u2019s aiming for steady 2% inflation before it lowers interest rates, being at 3% means the Fed wouldn\u2019t be ready to loosen the reins yet.",
      "Biden\u2019s statement would\u2019ve been wrong had he said unemployment has been \"4% or below\" for the longest stretch in 50 years. That distinction goes to Trump, who oversaw an unemployment rate of 4% or under for 24 months.",
      "The inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation was first noted by economist A. W. Phillips in 1958. \"He reasoned that when unemployment is high, workers are easy to find, so employers hardly raise wages, if they do so at all,\"\u00a0economist N. Gregory Mankiw\u00a0wrote in 2019. \"But when unemployment is low, employers have trouble attracting workers, so they raise wages faster.
