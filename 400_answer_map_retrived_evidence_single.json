    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that cargo ships \"can't get into port\" because of Donald Trump's executive order 13959. However, the evidence provided does not support this claim. Executive order 13959 is about recognizing United States citizenship, not restricting cargo ships from entering ports. The order was also blocked in response to a lawsuit and faced criticism for being \"blatantly unconstitutional\". There is no evidence to suggest that the order had any impact on cargo ships entering ports. The claim is likely a misinformation or a misunderstanding of the executive order's purpose and scope."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Democrats are \"asking for a blank check book to spend as much as they want without worrying about the repercussions\" is partially true. While Democrats have proposed large spending bills, such as the Build Back Better Act, which has a price tag of over $3 trillion, they have also proposed various measures to ensure accountability and transparency in government spending. For example, the bill includes provisions for regular reporting and oversight of spending, as well as measures to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Additionally, Democrats have also proposed increasing funding for programs that benefit low- and moderate-income families, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, which are designed to help alleviate poverty and promote economic mobility. However, it is also true that some Democrats have been criticized for their spending proposals, and some have argued that they do not provide sufficient details on how the money will be spent. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is also somewhat misleading and oversimplifies the complexity of the issue."

The evidence provided shows that Biden's plan does not include a 95% tax on prescription drugs, but rather an excise tax on drug companies if they don't sell drugs at prices negotiated with Medicare. Additionally, the evidence highlights that Biden's plan aims to lower prescription drug prices through various measures, including giving Medicare the power to negotiate prices, capping out-of-pocket drug costs, and allowing the federal government to negotiate prices with drugmakers for Medicare.

The claim that vaccinated people are the real threat to unvaccinated people is not supported by any credible evidence and is likely a misinformation or conspiracy theory. The evidence suggests that the main threat to unvaccinated people is other unvaccinated people, as stated by multiple sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Additionally, the data shows that unvaccinated people are at a higher risk of severe illness and death compared to vaccinated individuals, which further supports the fact that unvaccinated people are the ones at greater risk, not the other way around."

He was mocking this claim, saying that the government would not be able to find out who owns a gun and would not seize them. The full context of his statement is that he was debunking the NRA's claims, not making a threat himself.

    "[VERDICT]: HALF-TRUE  \n[REASON]: The claim is partially true. The evidence shows that China and India are leading in terms of the absolute change in carbon dioxide emissions since 1990, but not in terms of per capita emissions. The chart shared on Facebook and used by Sen. Dan Sullivan shows the percentage change in CO2 emissions, which makes it appear as though China and India are leading. However, when looking at the actual change in per capita emissions over time, measured in tons, the US and Japan lead. Additionally, the evidence highlights that China and India had very low levels of per capita emissions in 1990, which means their emissions have grown a lot since then. On the other hand, the US, UK, Germany, and Japan already had high levels of emissions in 1990, which didn't change much over the same period. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is accurate in terms of the absolute change in emissions, but not in terms of per capita emissions."

Roger Williams. The report and the spokesperson's statement both mention the projected increase in residential non-renewable energy expenditures, which is estimated to be around $18 billion (in 2020 dollars) or $19 billion (in 2018 dollars). The speech by Rep. Williams also mentions the same figure.

Additionally, the evidence does not provide information on Rittenhouse's exact jail stay, only stating that he was released from the Kenosha County jail on November 20, 2020, on $2 million bail.

    "[VERDICT]: HALF-TRUE  \n[REASON]: The claim that an increase in Medicare Part B premiums means \"America\u2019s seniors are paying the price for Biden\u2019s inflation crisis\" is partially true. While it is true that Medicare Part B premiums have increased, the evidence suggests that the increase is not directly caused by Biden's inflation crisis. The article states that Medicare Part B premiums have been growing steadily for decades to keep up with rising health spending, and several Medicare experts said the spike in the general inflation rate has little or nothing to do with the Medicare premium increase. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act caps the annual increase in the base beneficiary premium at 6%, which is a standard set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. However, the claim also implies that the increase in Medicare Part B premiums is a direct result of Biden's policies, which is not supported by the evidence. The article suggests that the increase is due to a combination of factors, including the aging of the baby boom generation and the rising cost of healthcare.

The evidence suggests that the US has accumulated debt over time, and the current debt is a result of a combination of factors, including past spending and borrowing. Additionally, the claim implies that the spending and borrowing are reckless, but the evidence does not support this characterization. The bill is a complex piece of legislation that aims to address various issues, and the spending and borrowing are part of a broader plan to address the country's economic and social needs.

However, the claim that this would have brought in $100 billion to the state's economy is an exaggeration. According to more recent estimates, Texas would receive federal funding between $5 billion and $6 billion annually if it expanded Medicaid, which is a significant amount, but not $100 billion. Additionally, the state would also be responsible for 10 cents on every dollar, or $600 million to $700 million annually, which would reduce the total amount of funding.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that polar bears have increased 400% in 45 years, but the evidence suggests that it is impossible to compare the global population of polar bears to 45 years ago due to the lack of scientific estimates for most of the world's polar bear populations until after the mid-1970s. Additionally, the current scientific consensus is that polar bear populations are declining due to climate change, not increasing. The claim also states that whales are nearly fully recovered, but the evidence suggests that while some whale populations have recovered, others are still threatened or endangered. The claim also states that extinctions are down 90% past century, but the evidence suggests that the number of extinctions has actually increased over the past century. The claim also states that koalas are doing fine, but the evidence suggests that koalas are actually declining and are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. The claim also states that banning wind turbines could save 85,000 birds of prey per year in the US, but the evidence suggests that there is no published research to support this claim.

The technology doesn't exist right now, and might never exist. The claim is also based on a TikTok video that appears to have originated on Natural News, which is a conspiracy theory website.

The available evidence suggests that the omicron variant has the capacity to infect both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and that the risk of infection is not solely dependent on vaccination status. Additionally, the claim is based on a selective presentation of data, as some studies and reports highlight the increased risk of infection among the vaccinated, while others emphasize the importance of vaccination in preventing severe illness and hospitalization.

However, the evidence also suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. For instance, the article notes that Virginia's standards are not necessarily a reflection of student performance, as students may still be learning and improving despite the low standards. Additionally, the article highlights that Virginia's standards are not the only factor affecting student performance, and that other factors such as funding and resources may also play a role.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence provided does not support the claim that the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy have been spraying the entire United States sky with a toxic brew of chemicals and other biologic agents since 2000. The evidence suggests that the claim is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by multiple government agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Aviation Administration, Homeland Security, and the Defense Department. Additionally, there is no credible scientific evidence to support the claim, and experts have stated that the condensation trails behind airplanes are not part of a secret program to poison the atmosphere with toxic chemicals.

The evidence provided does not support the claim of a 1,000% increase in neurological issues. However, it does support the claim of a 300% increase in miscarriages and almost 300% in cancer diagnoses. The evidence also mentions that the data is based on the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database (DMED) and that the five-year average for miscarriages was 1,499 codes per year, with 4,182 codes registered for the first 10 months of 2021. This suggests that the increase in miscarriages is statistically significant. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is partially supported by the evidence provided."

The evidence shows that the Electoral Count Act does not give the Vice President the power to reject votes or alter the outcome of the election. The Constitution is clear that the counting of electoral votes is the joint session's purpose, and Democratic cooperation in both chambers would have been needed to pass legislation. Additionally, the evidence shows that Pence did not have the authority to unilaterally overturn the election, and he correctly rejected any legal interpretation that suggested he did.

The court ruled that a 2019 change to the state's mail-in voting rules was unconstitutional, but this did not impact the 2020 election results. Biden still won Pennsylvania by about 80,000 votes, and the results were certified by the state and accepted by Congress.

For instance, experts and immigration authorities have rejected DeSantis' claim that unaccompanied children are not vetted, and the administration has exempted children from expulsion. Additionally, the administration has provided information on its policies and procedures, and there is no evidence to support the claim that there is no transparency.

The law does not cover all types of surprise bills, and some medical bills may still be unexpected and costly. Additionally, the law does not eliminate the possibility of surprise bills entirely, but rather provides new protections against certain types of surprise billing. Therefore, the claim is half-true."

However, the claim also states that inflation has been caused by the global economies shutting down all at once, reopening all at once, which is not entirely accurate.

While it is true that the pipeline would have had the capacity to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day, it is not clear that it would have actually produced that amount. The evidence suggests that the pipeline would have taken years to build and faced legal challenges, and even if it had been completed, it is unlikely that it would have produced a net increase of 830,000 barrels per day. Additionally, the US imports oil from many countries, not just Russia, so offsetting imports from Russia would not necessarily have been the primary purpose of the pipeline.

According to the evidence, the US was actually selling its oil at a loss, and the $27 figure is likely referring to the cost of production. Additionally, the claim that the US is now paying $105 a barrel to Russia is partially true, as the US has increased its imports of Russian oil, but it's not the only factor contributing to the current high oil prices. The global market is under pressure due to the pandemic and the war between Russia and Ukraine, which has a significant impact on oil prices.

Rivian Automotive, the company mentioned in the claim, is not owned by George Soros, and the deal is expected to offer incentives to the company in exchange for a proposed factory that would bring 7,500 jobs. The details of the plan are not yet known, but it is expected to be made public once negotiations are complete. Additionally, the evidence does not provide any evidence of a \"secret backroom deal\" or any evidence that Soros owns Rivian Automotive. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

However, the evidence suggests that while ICE detainees are required to be seen by a health professional within 24 hours if they have a medical issue, this is not a universal standard for all ICE detainees. Additionally, the evidence shows that veterans are seen by a medical professional within approximately 40 days on average, which is not necessarily \"within months\".

The evidence suggests that the claim is based on misinformation and lacks credible scientific evidence. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has not detected any unusual or unexpected patterns for deaths following immunization that would indicate that the COVID-19 vaccines are causing or contributing to deaths. The evidence also shows that vaccines are not connected to sudden death episodes, and that the benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the claim is based on a misunderstanding of the relationship between vaccination and infant mortality, as the data shows that areas with high vaccination rates do not have higher rates of infant mortality. Overall, the evidence does not support the claim that vaccines cause Sudden Death in adults and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome."

Multiple sources, including the FDA, NIH, and WHO, have stated that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of ivermectin for COVID-19 treatment. A large clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that ivermectin did not decrease hospitalizations or prolonged emergency room stays among COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the NIH's COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel has not recommended the use of ivermectin for COVID-19 treatment. While some studies have shown varying levels of effectiveness, the scientific consensus is that there is no evidence to support the use of ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19.

According to the evidence, the State Treasury Asset Reserve of Ohio invested in companies such as Exxon and Apple, which do business in China. However, these companies are multinational corporations with shareholders from the USA and other developed countries, not Chinese companies. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is accurate that Ohio public funds were invested in companies that do business in China, but it is misleading to imply that these investments were made in Chinese business interests. The second part of the claim, that Mandel opposed a bill holding Communist China accountable for cheating and stealing American jobs, is also partially true. Mandel did indicate opposition to tariffs on China in 2011, but he did not explicitly state that he opposed a bill holding China accountable for cheating and stealing American jobs.

Additionally, the evidence does not support the claim that 27% of people die from Tylenol use or that it kills at least 100,000 people per year. The evidence also suggests that the number of people who die from drug overdoses in the US is around 100,000 per year, but most of these deaths are attributed to fentanyl, not Tylenol.

However, the evidence also suggests that this increase was a bipartisan effort, not solely the work of \"liberals.\" Additionally, the evidence highlights that much of the accumulated debt is not even voted on, but rather results from automatic borrowing for Medicare and Medicaid.

While some Democrats have proposed policies that would provide a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, there is no evidence to suggest that this is their sole or primary electoral strategy. The claim is also exaggerated, as the number of immigrants who would be granted citizenship under these proposals is not tens of millions, but rather millions. Additionally, the claim is based on a flawed assumption that immigrants will automatically vote for Democrats, which is not supported by evidence. Many immigrants who become citizens may not vote for Democrats, and some may not vote at all. The claim is also based on a flawed understanding of the immigration process, which is more complex than simply granting amnesty to illegal aliens.

Additionally, the county officials and election administrators emphasized that these issues were not evidence of fraud, but rather examples of the complexity of the vote-by-mail process and voters' unfamiliarity with some of the intricate details.

The evidence provided shows that the CDC changed its guidance on COVID-19 to align it with other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, due to the availability of vaccines, treatments, and high population exposure to the virus. This change was not a result of misdiagnosing flu cases as COVID-19. Additionally, the evidence does not support the claim that COVID-19 tests were picking up flu cases and labeling them as COVID-19. The CDC has consistently emphasized the importance of testing and accurate diagnosis throughout the pandemic. The claim that \"they're going to do the same thing with monkeypox and shingles\" is also FALSE, as there is no evidence to support this claim.

Many of these states may still have restrictions on abortion access, and the claim does not account for the fact that some states may have laws that are more restrictive than others.

Wade made the United States an outlier among developed nations in the world on abortion rights. Many sources, including President Joe Biden, Martha Davis, and other legal experts, have stated that the decision has left the United States as one of the few developed countries without a national standard for access to abortion, with varying laws and restrictions across states. This is in contrast to most developed countries, which have a national standard for access to abortion or consistency across subnational entities.

The evidence suggests that some forms of gender-affirming care, such as social support and allowing children to express their gender identity through clothing and pronouns, are not experimental and are widely accepted as part of gender-affirming care. Additionally, there are studies that have demonstrated the positive effects of gender-affirming care on transgender youth, including reduced depression and suicidality.

The evidence shows that some bodies of water experienced an initial decrease in pollution when DeSantis entered office, but then an uptick toward the end of his first term. Additionally, the number of polluted estuaries decreased from 2.5 million acres in 2018 to 2.1 million in 2020, but then increased to 3.1 million in 2022.

The evidence provided supports this claim, showing that the number of Venezuelans encountered at the southern border decreased from around 1,100 per day to around 230 per day in November. This reduction is attributed to the parole program, which allows eligible Venezuelans to enter the U.S. legally and work for two years.

Abbott in 2021, which removed the requirement for schools to teach the \"I Have a Dream\" speech from state legislation, it does not eliminate the requirement entirely. According to the evidence, the requirement is still present in state education standards, and schools are not prohibited from teaching King's works.

Additionally, experts state that stool does not get \"stuck\" in the colon for extended periods of time, and the colon is always removing water to solidify stool, resulting in some amount of stool always being present.

While it is true that some classified documents, particularly those marked top secret/sensitive compartmented information, require special handling and are typically stored and viewed in SCIFs, it is not true that all classified documents can never be taken out of a SCIF. The evidence suggests that documents with lower classifications can be removed from a SCIF as long as proper protocols are followed, and even top secret/sensitive compartmented information can be removed from a SCIF if proper protocols are followed. Additionally, some classified documents may not even require storage in a SCIF, as they may be stored in less restrictive classified spaces.

For example, some states require same-day registrants to sign an oath attesting that they're providing accurate information, and voters who provide false information or commit fraud are subject to criminal charges.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that the 5 states with the highest gun homicide rates have loose gun laws, and the 5 states with the lowest rates have some of the toughest laws. The evidence suggests that this is partially true. The 5 states with the highest gun homicide rates (Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Missouri, and South Carolina) do have relatively permissive gun laws, such as allowing guns to be carried without a permit and having barriers to enforce federal gun laws. However, the evidence also shows that some states with relatively permissive gun laws (such as Nebraska and North Dakota) have low rates of gun homicides, and some states with stricter gun laws (such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Minnesota) are in the bottom 10 for gun homicide rates. Additionally, the evidence suggests that factors beyond gun laws, such as poverty rates and trauma care resources, can also influence a state's gun homicide rate. Therefore, while there is some correlation between gun laws and gun homicide rates, the claim is not entirely accurate."

Additionally, some schools may choose to teach the document in a minimal or cursory manner, but this does not necessarily mean that it is not taught at all.

The recommended reparations are estimated to be around $13,619 per year of residency, which would be around $1 million for a 71-year-old resident.

However, the evidence also highlights that not all districts offer pre-K programs, and some districts have limited seats, which means that not all eligible children have access to public preschool. Additionally, the claim is not entirely accurate as it implies that 96% of eligible children will attend public preschool, when in reality, the funding is available for districts to serve preschoolers, but not every district has done so.

The evidence includes quotes from the Miami-Dade Superintendent, data from the school district, and reports from reputable news sources. The evidence also shows that there has been an increase in the number of new students from these four countries, which supports the claim. The only potential issue is that the claim specifically states \"just last year,\" which could be interpreted as referring to the 2021-22 school year, but the evidence suggests that the increase in new students from these countries has been ongoing, with the number of new students in the 2022-23 school year being nearly double that of the previous year.

In fact, many studies have found no significant impact or even declines in employment rates due to work requirements. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the effectiveness of work requirements in increasing employment depends on the specific program and context in which they are implemented. For example, some studies have found that work requirements can be effective in certain programs, such as the 1990s welfare-to-work requirements, but not in others, such as food stamps or Medicaid.

The evidence suggests that Wisconsin has a history of electing both Democratic and Republican leaders, and its voting patterns are not as straightforward as being solely blue.

According to the evidence, the city of Milwaukee announced the five in-person voting centers for the April 7, 2020, election on April 3, 2020, which is five days before the election. Additionally, the city's Election Commission executive director acknowledged that the lack of notice under existing standards was due to the pandemic and other factors.

For example, his executive order on birthright citizenship, which stated that children born to non-immigrant visa holders are not automatically US citizens, was a significant change to the existing policy. Additionally, his administration's immigration enforcement policies, such as the \"zero tolerance\" policy, led to the separation of thousands of families at the border.

While Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law prohibiting the teaching of critical race theory in Florida's workplaces and schools, it is unclear whether the theory was actually being taught in K-12 schools before the law was passed. The evidence suggests that critical race theory was not being taught in Florida's elementary, middle, or high schools, as stated by educators, school officials, and several Florida public school districts. However, the law's language is broad and could potentially impact other educational materials or discussions that touch on systemic racism and privilege, which are core components of critical race theory.

Instead, it requires election officials to compare voter signatures on mail ballot envelopes with the corresponding signatures in the voter registration records. If a signature does not match, the bill allows for the ballot to be challenged, but it does not automatically reject the vote.

While it is true that the WHO is developing a pandemic treaty, the evidence suggests that the treaty does not aim to remove human rights protections, enforce surveillance and censorship, or eliminate freedom of speech. The treaty is intended to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, and to promote cooperation among countries to address public health crises. The WHO's website states that the treaty will be \"coherent with and complementary to existing International Health Regulations\" and that it will \"reaffirm the principle of sovereignty of States Parties in addressing public health matters.\" Additionally, the treaty is being developed with input from member states and is expected to be agreed upon by governments, which suggests that it will not impose any significant restrictions on human rights or freedom of speech. However, some critics have raised concerns about the potential impact of the treaty on national sovereignty and the potential for the WHO to exert more control over countries' public health policies.

Experts have stated that the number of people who could have been removed from Medicaid is still being processed and is not yet clear.

The evidence suggests that the practice of requiring promissory notes has varied over time and has been used in specific circumstances, such as during times of war or natural disaster.

However, there is no evidence that Kim Jong Un specifically blamed President Biden for these conflicts. Additionally, the claim states that Kim Jong Un expressed support for Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, but the evidence only shows that Kim Jong Un mentioned Trump's name in the context of a speech, without explicitly endorsing him.

Additionally, the evidence also shows that China accounts for a smaller percentage of imports for other active pharmaceutical ingredients, such as 18% in 2019. Furthermore, the U.S. produces a significant amount of pharmaceutical ingredients domestically, and exports some to China.

Additionally, the Russian hypersonic missiles are reportedly using decades-old technology, which may not be as advanced as the technology being developed by the U.S. Therefore, while Russia has an advantage in the short term, the claim that Russia has hypersonic missile capabilities ahead of that of the U.S. is not entirely accurate."

Additionally, the Federal Reserve's actions, such as raising interest rates, have also played a significant role in addressing inflation. The claim's assertion that the government's actions had \"nothing to do with getting our economy back in line\" is also disputed by the evidence, as the Federal Reserve's analysis suggests that government spending has contributed to higher inflation in the United States compared to other developed nations.

While it is true that prescription drug prices vary significantly between countries, the claim is an oversimplification. The evidence shows that the cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. is generally higher than in other developed countries, but there are exceptions. For example, the cost of unbranded generic drugs is actually lower in the U.S. compared to other countries. Additionally, the claim does not account for the complexity of international drug pricing, including factors such as regulatory differences, taxes, and insurance coverage. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE, as it is partially accurate but also oversimplifies the issue."

While Milwaukee did not completely defund the police, the city did make significant budget cuts to the police department. According to the evidence, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson stated that the city \"never defunded the police\", but other evidence suggests that the police department has been negatively impacted by city budgets. This suggests that while the city did not completely eliminate the police department, it did make significant cuts that had an impact on the department's operations.

In fact, the evidence suggests that Democrats do deport undocumented migrants, as evidenced by the fact that President Biden was trying to deport as many border crossers as he could. Additionally, the evidence shows that immigrants who become citizens in the future may not necessarily vote for Democrats, and that voting by immigrants in the U.S. illegally is rare and carries serious risks. Furthermore, federal law prohibits non-citizens, including immigrants in the country illegally, from voting in federal elections. Therefore, the claim that Democrats don't deport undocumented migrants because they are likely to vote for them is FALSE."

For example, the FEND Off Fentanyl Act aims to stop the flow of fentanyl into the country, and law enforcement agencies have seized large quantities of the drug. Additionally, public health approaches are being implemented to reduce the demand for fentanyl. In contrast, the evidence does not suggest that the government has taken similar actions to stop the distribution of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which are FDA-approved drugs used for specific medical purposes.

According to the evidence, the highest number of deportations in a single year was in 2021, with around 1.4 million removals, returns, and Title 42 expulsions. However, the evidence also shows that the number of encounters has increased, and under Biden, around 3.8 million encounters had resulted in people being removed, returned, or expelled from the U.S. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is not entirely accurate, as the highest number of removals and returns occurred in 2021, not since May of last year."

According to the evidence, many people who cross the border illegally cannot be immediately deported due to immigration law, congressional appropriations, and foreign policy.

For example, it mentions that Joe Biden's margin of victory in the 2020 presidential election was less than 21,000 votes, and that the 2018 gubernatorial election was decided by less than 30,000 votes. Additionally, the evidence mentions that elections in Wisconsin often come down to a few votes per ward, which could suggest that many elections are decided by a narrow margin. However, the evidence does not provide a comprehensive list of all elections in Wisconsin over the past 24 years, so it is impossible to verify the claim with certainty.

The Inflation Reduction Act does aim to reduce the prices of prescription drugs under Medicare by allowing the government to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies. However, the claim also states that this will result in a $160 billion reduction in the federal deficit, which is not entirely accurate. According to the evidence, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the law will reduce the federal deficit by $237 billion over 10 years, not $160 billion. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the law will also increase spending in some areas, which would offset some of the deficit reduction. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is partially accurate but also omits important details and exaggerates the magnitude of the deficit reduction."

Additionally, the transcript aligns with the committee's conclusion that Trump did not order the deployment of 10,000 National Guard troops before or during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.

The Chinese government has a 1% stake in one of ByteDance's China-based subsidiaries, Beijing Douyin Information Service Co., but this is not the same as owning the company. Additionally, the evidence suggests that ByteDance has provided disclosures to Washington, D.C. courts, funders, and Chinese government documents, which show that 60% of TikTok is owned by global investors. The claim that the Chinese government \"owns\" ByteDance is therefore FALSE."

However, the claim implies that there is something unusual or ominous about the eclipse, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that the National Guard's assistance is a standard response to large-scale events, and the warnings about stockpiling supplies are typical advice given by emergency management officials in anticipation of large crowds.

Much like what is done in communist countries\" is FALSE. The evidence suggests that the judgment is a result of a civil fraud case, where Trump and his company were found liable for inflating the value of their assets, and the potential property seizure is a consequence of that judgment. This is not comparable to the actions of communist countries, where seizures are often done without due process or legal basis. The experts quoted in the evidence also disagree with Trump's comparison, stating that the case is not comparable to seizures in communist countries. Additionally, the evidence shows that the judgment was issued by a New York State Supreme Court Justice, and Trump has the legal right to appeal the decision. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

The White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates stated that the date was not chosen intentionally, and the fact that Easter and Transgender Day of Visibility sometimes coincide due to the lunar calendar used to determine the date of Easter.

While it does contain pesticides, it is not a pesticide itself, but rather a product used to wash and sanitize produce.

The better way to think about it is that it\u2019s 18%, 19% over the last three years.\" The evidence suggests that Biden's statement is partially accurate. While it is true that inflation has not decreased from 9% to 3% as Biden claimed, it is also true that the year-over-year inflation rate has fallen since its 2022 peak under Biden.

For example, Walgreens closed 200 stores in 2019, under Trump's presidency, and Gap announced 350 store closures in 2020, also under Trump's presidency. Additionally, the claim does not provide evidence that the store closures are solely due to Biden's policies, as some companies have cited lower sales or business rebrands as the reason for the closures.

The provision took effect on September 23, 2010, and it allowed young people to stay on their parents' health insurance until they turn 26.

Additionally, the FBI did not respond to inquiries about a \"Jonathan Willis\" being questioned or fired from a law enforcement job. Furthermore, the photo of the two snipers on the roof does not show a vest with the name \"Jonathan Willis\". The claim is likely a fabrication."

However, the evidence provided does not support this claim. In fact, the evidence suggests that Gallego voted against allowing noncitizens to vote in Washington, D.C. local elections, and there is no evidence that he voted to allow millions of people who entered the country illegally to vote in the upcoming election. Additionally, the evidence highlights the risks and challenges associated with noncitizens voting, including the possibility of deportation or incarceration, which makes it unlikely that millions of people who entered the country illegally would be able to vote.

While the plan does contain language that could potentially threaten the practice of IVF and access to some forms of contraception, it does not explicitly restrict access to these services. Additionally, experts and fact-checking organizations have found no mention of IVF or specific recommendations to curtail the practice in the document. The plan's focus is on restricting some forms of emergency contraception and allowing employers to deny coverage of contraception based on moral or religious exemptions, but this is not the same as restricting access to IVF and contraception in general.

The data shows that manufacturing employment fell by 48,000 from its prepandemic peak in January 2019 to February 2020, which is a significant decline, but not a recession. Additionally, the evidence also suggests that the manufacturing sector recovered quickly after the pandemic, with employment returning to pre-pandemic levels by August 2022.

The evidence shows that the US released prisoners held by the US government in exchange for having other nations free Americans held abroad, and in some cases, the US agreed to unfreeze funds or release assets belonging to the opposing country. For example, the US agreed to release $6 billion in Iranian funds and free American prisoners in exchange for the release of five American citizens held in Iran.

Additionally, the video does not provide any evidence that the people in line were immigrants illegally in the U.S. Furthermore, the claim that \"all you need to vote is a driver's license\" is also false, as voting in federal elections requires U.S. citizenship, and Florida does not allow non-citizens to vote in federal elections.

Additionally, Brown clarified that he does not support cutting Social Security or Medicare.

The plan is aimed at taxing the wealthy, and it would apply to households with incomes above $400,000. The tax would be on the unrealized gains, not on the property itself. The claim is also misleading because it implies that the tax would be on the increased value of the house, which is not accurate. The tax would be on the unrealized gains, which could be from various assets, not just real estate.

The evidence suggests that Brown has generally supported LGBTQ+ rights, including allowing transgender athletes to participate in sports and supporting access to gender-affirming care, but it does not provide direct evidence of his support for the specific procedures mentioned in the claim.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim is partially true because the evidence shows that Kamala Harris has supported gun buybacks and mandatory buyback programs for assault weapons in the past. However, the evidence also shows that she no longer holds this position and has clarified that she does not support mandatory buybacks. The claim is not entirely false because it is based on a specific policy stance that Harris held in the past, but it is also not entirely true because she has since changed her position."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence provided shows that The Atlantic did not publish an article with the headline \"Trump is Literally Hitler\". The image circulating on social media is a fabricated screenshot, and The Atlantic's website does not have any article with that title. The article that was actually published by The Atlantic was titled \"Trump: \u2018I need the kind of generals that Hitler had.\u2019\" and was not about Trump being compared to Hitler. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"As of today, we have cut the flow of immigration by over half\" is partially true. The evidence suggests that there has been a decrease in immigration, but it's not clear if it's exactly \"over half\". Some sources mention a 50% decrease, while others provide different numbers. For example, L\u00f3pez Obrador mentioned a 50% decrease in the number of migrants reaching the southern U.S. border, but other sources provide different figures. Additionally, the evidence does not provide a clear timeline or specific data to support the claim that the decrease is \"as of today\". Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Ruben Gallego wanted to defund the police and co-sponsored legislation to do so. However, the evidence suggests that Gallego has not supported defunding the police. He has co-sponsored legislation to restrict the transfer of military weapons to law enforcement and to curb the militarization of local police forces, but this is not the same as defunding the police. Additionally, Gallego's campaign has stated that he does not support defunding the police and has secured funding to hire more police officers and provide crime-stopping resources to state and local law enforcement. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate, but also misleading and incomplete."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence provided does not support the claim that Vice President Kamala Harris has called Donald Trump \"Adolf Hitler.\" While the evidence does mention that Trump accused Harris of calling him Adolf Hitler, there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, the evidence suggests that Trump is the one who has made the comparison, not Harris. Additionally, the evidence does not provide any quotes or direct evidence of Harris making such a comparison. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Kari Lake is threatening Social Security and Medicare is partially true. While Lake has expressed concerns about the sustainability of these programs, she has also stated that she would not touch funding for them. The evidence suggests that Lake has made contradictory statements about Social Security and Medicare, which may be interpreted as threatening or endangering these programs. However, it is important to note that Lake has not explicitly stated that she would cut or eliminate these programs. The claim is half-true because it is based on a partial and potentially misleading representation of Lake's stance on Social Security and Medicare."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that the United States Postal Service recently changed the delivery method of absentee mail-in ballots to hide evidence of absentee mail-in ballot fraud. However, the evidence provided shows that the Postal Service has not changed its procedures for delivering absentee ballots, and U.S. Postal Service spokesperson Martha Johnson stated that the Postal Service has used the same procedures for previous general elections. Additionally, the evidence does not support the claim that the Postal Service is hiding evidence of absentee mail-in ballot fraud. The claim is likely an unfounded conspiracy theory."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that Kamala Harris, as California attorney general, redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as a totally nonviolent crime. However, the evidence provided shows that this is not accurate. Proposition 57, which was passed during Harris' tenure as attorney general, did not redefine these crimes as nonviolent. Instead, it reclassified certain nonviolent felonies to allow for earlier parole eligibility. Additionally, the evidence shows that these crimes were already considered nonviolent under California law, and Harris' actions did not change that. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

Jacky Rosen, a Democratic opponent, and Make the Road Nevada, a liberal political action committee, have accused Brown of wanting to cut these programs. Additionally, Brown has expressed support for a balanced budget amendment, which economists say would lead to steep cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. While some sources may have exaggerated or mischaracterized Brown's positions, the evidence collectively suggests that he has indeed expressed support for cutting these programs."

The evidence suggests that the report was about an upcoming ballot drop, not a sudden arrival of 50,000 ballots. Additionally, the trucks seen arriving in the MSNBC report did not contain any ballots, according to a spokesperson for Philadelphia City Commissioner Seth Bluestein. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misinformation."

While Trump and Epstein were acquaintances and operated in the same social circles, there is no documented evidence that Trump visited Epstein's private island, Little St. James in the Virgin Islands, where Epstein allegedly sexually abused underage girls. Trump has denied visiting the island, and flight logs show that Trump flew on Epstein's private plane, but there is no evidence of him visiting the island. Additionally, multiple sources, including Trump himself, have denied the claim. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim that Joe Biden's 80 million votes in 2020 were a \"lie\" is FALSE. The evidence provided does not support this claim. In fact, the evidence suggests that the claim is baseless and has been repeatedly refuted by fact-checking organizations, polls, and officials. The claim is likely an attempt to spread misinformation and undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. The evidence provided includes statements from PolitiFact, which has repeatedly rated claims that the 2020 election was rigged or that Joe Biden was illegitimately elected as FALSE. Additionally, polls conducted by the University of Massachusetts Amherst and YouGov, and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, found that a majority of respondents believed Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election was legitimate. There is no credible evidence to support the claim that Joe Biden did not receive 80 million votes in the 2020 election."

However, the evidence retrieved does not support this claim. According to the evidence, Wacksman did not make any statement about Trump's deportation plan and its potential impact on housing affordability. In fact, the evidence suggests that housing experts have expressed concerns that Trump's plan could exacerbate home prices and worsen the housing shortage. Additionally, the evidence does not provide any credible source or quote from Wacksman supporting the claim. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim that a \"ballot dump\" around 4 a.m. in Milwaukee shows the Wisconsin Senate election was stolen from the Republican candidate is FALSE. The evidence provided shows that the 4 a.m. influx of absentee ballots was expected and transparent, as Wisconsin law prohibits processing absentee ballots before 7 a.m. on Election Day. The Republican challenger, Eric Hovde, himself acknowledged that the absentee ballot pattern didn't match what he got on Election Day, but this is not evidence of fraud or election theft. Additionally, the claims of fraud and \"ballot harvesting\" made by True the Vote and others are unsubstantiated and lack concrete evidence. The Wisconsin Election Commission and other authorities have not found any evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities in the election. The claim is likely fueled by misinformation and conspiracy theories."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim \"Half of all Ukrainian aid was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election\" is FALSE because the evidence provided does not support this claim. While there are mentions of corruption and embezzlement of aid money in Ukraine, there is no credible evidence to suggest that half of the aid was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election. In fact, the evidence suggests that the majority of the aid was used for military and humanitarian purposes, and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that his country has received less than half of the over $177 billion in aid sent by the United States. Additionally, the claim is not supported by any credible sources or evidence, and is likely a conspiracy theory."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Sen. John Thune announces plans to cut Social Security after meeting with Elon Musk. However, the evidence suggests that Thune did not announce any plans to cut Social Security. Instead, he mentioned that \"perhaps mandatory programs are areas that they\u2019re looking to make cuts in, like Social Security for example\" in a conversation with Julie Tsirkin, NBC News\u2019 congressional correspondent. This statement is not a formal announcement or a plan to cut Social Security, but rather a hypothetical example of potential areas for cuts.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence provided does not support the claim that a second attack in New Orleans has been uncovered, police are searching. The evidence suggests that the claim is likely a fabrication, as there is no credible reporting or information supporting the existence of a second attack in New Orleans. The evidence also suggests that the claim may be part of a disinformation campaign, as the same text and photos are being used in multiple posts, and the details of the supposed attack are not consistent with any known events in New Orleans. Additionally, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have not reported any such incident. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that Los Angeles, Hollywood, and California will get 100% aid for 180 days, while Western North Carolina will get $750. However, the evidence suggests that the claim is false. The evidence shows that the federal cost share for disaster response was increased to 100% in both California and North Carolina, but there is no evidence to suggest that Los Angeles and Hollywood are receiving 100% aid for 180 days. Additionally, the evidence suggests that North Carolina received $750 million in emergency funds, not $750. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual aid provided to the two regions."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that Oregon sent 60 fire trucks to California to help with the fires, but they're being held in Sacramento for emissions testing. However, the evidence provided shows that Oregon sent firefighting teams to help with the Los Angeles fires, and they were safety-checked by California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) when they arrived. The teams were not held in Sacramento for emissions testing, but rather went through a routine safety check to ensure their equipment was mechanically sound. Additionally, Cal Fire stated that no out-of-state vehicles, including the Oregon fire trucks, were turned around or refused service, and all repairs were completed the same day with the exception of a couple that required parts. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

In fact, the evidence suggests that Trump's executive order recognized two sexes, male and female, and did not change the legal classification of individuals. Additionally, legal scholars and experts have challenged the claim that the order would legally affect \"every single person's\" sex. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misinformation."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim is partially true, but also partially misleading. Trump did not change the Obama policy on hiring air traffic controllers. In fact, the Obama administration had already implemented a hiring assessment for air traffic controllers in 2014, and Trump did not reverse this policy. However, Trump did sign an executive order in 2017 that aimed to improve the hiring process for air traffic controllers, which was a continuation of the efforts started by the Obama administration. Additionally, Trump's claim that Biden changed the policy is also misleading, as Biden did not reinstate the Obama-era hiring protocol, but rather implemented a new pathway for hiring air traffic controllers through state plans. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also contains misleading information."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that FEMA sent $59M to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants, and that this money was meant for American disaster relief. However, the evidence suggests that FEMA did not directly give money to luxury hotels, but rather to New York City, which then used the funds to house migrants. Additionally, the money did not come from the Disaster Relief Fund, but rather from a separate program funded by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. While the claim is partially accurate in that FEMA did provide funding for migrant housing, it is misleading in its characterization of the funding source and the purpose of the funding. Therefore, the verdict is HALF-TRUE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that President Joe Biden \"fired\" 14,000 Keystone XL pipeline workers \"on day one\" of his administration is partially true. While it is accurate that Biden revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office, the claim that 14,000 workers were fired on that day is an exaggeration.\n\nAccording to the evidence, TC Energy, the company behind the project, \"let go 1,000 workers in both the U.S. and Canada\" one day after Biden revoked the permit. This suggests that the actual number of workers affected was significantly lower than 14,000. Additionally, estimates vary on the number of jobs the Keystone XL pipeline would have created, and it's unclear how many of those jobs would have been lost as a result of the permit revocation.\n\nTherefore, while the claim is partially true in the sense that Biden did take action to halt the pipeline project, the claim that 14,000 workers were fired on day one is an exaggeration and should be considered HALF-TRUE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"You either have XX or XY chromosomes. Those are the options\" is partially true. While it is true that most people are born with either XX or XY chromosomes, which determine their biological sex, the evidence provided shows that there are exceptions. For example, people with Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) or Turner syndrome (X) may have chromosomes that do not fit into the typical XX or XY categories. Additionally, there are intersex conditions that do not involve chromosomes, and some people may have chromosomes that do not align with their gender identity. Therefore, while the claim is generally true, it is not entirely accurate and oversimplifies the complexity of human biology and gender identity."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that \"All armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever\" because of Trump policies, and \"it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite.\" However, the evidence suggests that the military recruitment results were already improving before Trump took office. The Army's best recruiting month in 15 years was in January, which was before Trump's presidency. Additionally, the Marine Corps Recruiting Command reported that recruiters outperformed the first five months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the same timeframe the previous year, which was before Trump took office. While it is possible that Trump's policies may have had some impact on recruitment, it is not accurate to say that the results were \"exactly the opposite\" just a few months prior. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."
