      "Trump\u2019s low average price was shaped by the opposite phenomenon that Biden experienced. Most of Trump\u2019s final year in office occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when automobile use was sharply lower. This drove gasoline prices to unusually low levels.",
      "There are many factors at play in the steady climb in gas prices since Biden took office, including increased demand after pandemic lockdowns ended, inflation and, now, the war in Ukraine. But lower oil production in the U.S. isn\u2019t one of them.",

Meanwhile,\u00a0 the sharpest increases at the pump have come since the start of war in Ukraine.",
      "From January 2021 to June 2022, inflation rose precipitously, primarily because of supply shortages as the pandemic receded and demand rose. Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan, which put more money into Americans\u2019 pockets when supply was spotty, intensified the increase in prices, as did Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The war sent U.S. gasoline prices to near-record highs.",

      "However, this needs context: That low price came early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when fewer people were on the road. This pushed gasoline prices to unusually low levels.",
      "Experts say that Biden\u2019s policies may have had a marginal effect on gasoline prices but for the most part, the price of gasoline \u2014 whether it\u2019s high or low by historical standards \u2014 is not something a president can significantly control.",
      "During Biden\u2019s first week in office, the national average retail gasoline price was $2.39 per gallon. When Rose tweeted, the price had risen to $3.53. That\u2019s an increase of just under 48%, not 63%.",
      "Republicans blame President Joe Biden for this year\u2019s historic surge in inflation reflected in higher prices for almost everything \u2014 from cars and gas to food and housing. They see last month\u2019s 6.2% annual inflation rate \u2014 the highest in decades and mostly driven by an increase in consumer spending and supply issues related to the COVID-19\u00a0pandemic \u2014 as a ticket to taking back control of Congress in next year\u2019s midterm elections."

      "Under my plan, unemployment has been under 4% for two full years now, and inflation has been at the pre-pandemic level of 2% over the last half year.",
      "Summers\u2019 premise \u2014 that there are a decent number of time periods when unemployment was below 4% at the same time inflation was above 4% \u2014 has problems from the start. In reality, there haven\u2019t been many such periods.",
      "Economists told PolitiFact that there can still be some linkage between high unemployment and low inflation (and vice versa). But this correlation can be negated by a variety of factors \u2014 factors that have been present in the economy since at least the 1990s.",
      "For about a year in 1951, unemployment was under 4% while inflation was above 4%. But inflation then dropped to 1.1% or less for the six months immediately before a recession in 1953, so this is not unequivocal evidence for Summers\u2019 larger point about high inflation being a precursor to a recession.",
      "We found only one clear example of Summers\u2019 rule holding \u2014 a two-year period in 1968 and 1969 when unemployment was under 4% and inflation was above 4%. That came in the immediate run-up to a recession.",
      "Currently, the unemployment rate is 3.6% and the inflation rate is 8.6%, so if Summers\u2019 rule is correct, then the U.S. should be facing a recession sometime in the next 24 months.",
      "Meanwhile, this is before we factor in high inflation. We cross-checked the months of sub-4% unemployment with inflation rates and found that none of the five months in 2000 also had inflation above 4%.",
      "Biden said, \"First of all, (a recession is) not inevitable. Secondly, we\u2019re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation. It\u2019s bad. Isn\u2019t it kind of interesting? If it\u2019s my fault, why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? I\u2019m not being a wise guy.\"",
      "\"Yesterday, we learned the economy grew faster than expected last quarter,\" Biden said. \"And this morning, we saw data showing that last month the annual rate of inflation continued to decline. So, inflation is now at its lowest point in two years. And wages are up after being adjusted for inflation.\"",
      "Americans are facing conflicting signals on the economy. The economy is growing rapidly, unemployment is low, and wages are rising. But inflation \u2014 a broad pattern of rising consumer prices \u2014 is at a four-decade high, and for many voters, that fact seems to be crowding out any other economic news.",
      "Let\u2019s start by looking just at the periods when unemployment was below 4%. Since 1948, unemployment has been this low only on four general occasions.",
      "One part of Pelosi\u2019s comments caught our attention \u2014 that \"when unemployment goes down, inflation goes up.\" That seemed at odds with economic data of recent years, when unemployment was quite low, but so was inflation.",
      "Consider a comparison of the rates of inflation and unemployment from 2012 to the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Inflation ran in a pretty narrow range during that period, from effectively zero to 2.9%. Yet, over the same time span, unemployment ranged from 8.3% (a level rarely reached going back to 1950) all the way down to 3.5% (close to a record low).",
      "So, before mid-2018, there were a grand total of five months since 1970 in which unemployment was under 4%. That's less than 1% of the months over the past half century or so.",
      "The inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation was first noted by economist A. W. Phillips in 1958. \"He reasoned that when unemployment is high, workers are easy to find, so employers hardly raise wages, if they do so at all,\"\u00a0economist N. Gregory Mankiw\u00a0wrote in 2019. \"But when unemployment is low, employers have trouble attracting workers, so they raise wages faster. Inflation in wages soon turns into inflation in the prices of goods and services.\"",
      "In other words, during the nearly half-century from 1970 to 2018, there was not a single example of Summers' stated condition \u2014 unemployment under 4% and inflation over 4% \u2014 ever existing.",
      "By contrast, defining a \"recession\" for one sector, such as manufacturing, is murkier. Because there\u2019s no official arbiter, someone can use one of several metrics, particularly employment level and output in goods.",
      "For the following two years \u2014 April 2021 to April 2023 \u2014 inflation rose faster than wages. That means real (or inflation-adjusted) wages were falling.",

In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019.\nThe first caveat to Sullivan\u2019s approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is \"conveniently misleading.\" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions.\n\"Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Jackson said.\nLooking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%.",

      "And while the Facebook post claims that low gas prices were the work of former President Donald Trump, the truth is that it was due largely to the COVID-19 pandemic, when people traveled far less and pushed down demand. At that time, the \u200b\u200bU.S. Energy Information Administration reported that the price of oil hit a record low of $9.12 per barrel.

No payments were made to the consultant last year, as Earle-Sears claimed.\nThere\u2019s much debate over the contention of Earle-Sears and others that the money was spent \"to bring CRT in some form or fashion to the school system.\"\nWayde Byard, spokesman for Loudoun schools, told us the county paid $34,167 in June 2020 for seminars on critical race theory. He said the purpose was to familiarize senior officials with the theory and that no additional money was spent on CRT.\nLoudoun Superintendent Scott Ziegler says the theory is not being taught to students. He says critics are conflating the theory with Loudoun\u2019s efforts to bring equity to the way students are treated in school, where most of the money was spent.",

In 2020, when the city was strained by\u00a0COVID-19 quarantines and related judicial delays, that figure was 35%. It was 39% in 2019 and 40% in 2018.",

      "Bragg argued that investing in alternatives to incarceration would reduce recidivism and allow his office\u2019s resources to be dedicated to the most serious, and often violent, crimes. Reducing the prosecution of nonviolent offenses would disproportionately benefit people of color.",
      "\"It is very common\" for prosecutors to submit as evidence a summary of records that omits some they don't deem relevant, as an aid to the jury, said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a criminal defense attorney who worked at the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office before Bragg took office. \"The judge will tell the jury this is what it is and what it is for.

Of the felony cases that survived review, 52% were downgraded to a misdemeanor, 7% were downgraded to a lower-level felony, 8% were upgraded to a different felony, 33% were an equivalent felony, and in 0.1% of cases, 12 in all, the charge was downgraded to a violation. The data does not signal\u00a0why prosecutors changed the charges, though experts told us this practice is not unusual.",

Although\u00a0police officers must make decisions in the moment, prosecutors can take a longer view, weigh evidence\u00a0and think through how they can build a case, Harris-Calvin said.",
      "But in the recent past, before Bragg took over, the rates of downgrading felonies to misdemeanors were higher in other New York City boroughs. Similar state data compiled by the Data Collaborative for Justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice shows that in 2021, the most recent year with available data, three other boroughs had higher rates: 56% in the Bronx, 57% in Brooklyn and 59% in Queens. (This data, which could have included a different set of cases, showed that in Manhattan in 2021, the rate was 52%.)",

In Florida, for example, a six-week abortion ban that Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law is on hold while the state\u2019s Supreme Court weighs whether Florida\u2019s current 15-week ban is constitutional, causing uncertainty for both patients and doctors.",

      "\"That fact, as demonstrated by multiple publicly available studies, is for years and years New Yorkers have paid significantly more in taxes than they get back in federal dollars, especially compared to other states,\" said Will Kiley, a LaLota spokesperson. \"This imbalance was temporarily interrupted during the height of COVID spending. At this point, any data that continues to take COVID spending into account is simply misleading and distracts from the harsh reality that New York taxpayers routinely get hosed by Washington.\"",
      "in December 2022. \"Now, in the midst of COVID, we spent what we needed to spend to get American families and American businesses through that worst pandemic in 100 years. But I do believe whoever is the next president, it\u2019ll be important that we bring about the kinds of reforms and we make the kinds of choices necessary to lift the burden of more than $30 trillion in debt on our children and grandchildren.\"",
      "Biden has presided over smaller deficits than former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration saw in its final year. However, Biden\u2019s remarks omit important context about the unusual federal spending that both presidents approved to stabilize the country during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "The deficit remained high in 2021, another significant pandemic year. That year, a newly elected Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act, which provided more money for the pandemic response. In 2021, the deficit fell but remained historically high, at $2.78 trillion.",
      "Making this a fair comparison is complicated. The coronavirus pandemic dramatically affected the economy and distorted economic statistics from that period \u2014 particularly income statistics, since Americans received",
      "Another complicating factor is the effect of the spending that came before Biden took office. Two bipartisan COVID-relief packages cost over $3 trillion. Goldwein said it all contributed to inflation, though he thinks the American Rescue Plan added more, because it came as the economy was already springing back. Holtz-Eakin also said that the earlier spending was more in line with the level of economic damage due to the pandemic.",
      "But regardless of the large increase during the pandemic, the trend of higher debt-to-GDP ratios has been around during other administrations.",

      "During the coronavirus pandemic, this metric has been unusually volatile. That\u2019s because the federal government enacted several massive bills that provided cash payments, expanded unemployment insurance, business loans, and liberalized child tax credits to help the nation cope with an unprecedentedly sudden economic shutdown after the virus emerged.",
      "Part of the reason for larger disposable incomes is government payments, but another part is\u00a0that Americans were unable to spend what they would have on many services, including restaurants and tourism during the pandemic.",
      "Economists now widely agree that the critics had a point. They say the law put too much money in Americans\u2019 pockets when the pandemic had hampered global supply chains, meaning too much cash was chasing too few goods and services. Because demand outstripped supply, prices surged.",
      "Inflation, which appears to have driven the spike in credit card debt, has causes that \"go back to (the) COVID(-19 pandemic) \u2014 issues like supply-chain constraints, workforce shortages, and other factors,\" John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research, told PolitiFact West Virginia in September. \"That is much larger than any particular Biden policy.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve analysis didn\u2019t blame inflation solely on government spending. It said global supply chain problems and changes in spending patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed up inflation worldwide. The study did blame higher U.S. government spending for making inflation higher in the United States than in other developed nations since the first half of 2021.",
      "The comparison looks more favorable to Biden and Harris if someone uses as the baseline February 2020, the last month before the pandemic started. Economists consider this a useful comparison because that was the last month before the pandemic, which began distorting economic data. Since then, prices have risen by 20.9%, and wages have risen by 23.3%. So, during that period, Americans\u2019 spending power has run ahead of inflation.",

(The percentage was higher in 2020, but that was because of temporary tax relief provisions during the coronavirus pandemic, so tax experts said it\u2019s best to use the 2019 pre-pandemic figure.)",

      "It\u2019s worth noting that the U.K. studies compared populations of people who had tested positive for COVID-19. Those who didn\u2019t contract omicron would have been infected by another variant, possibly one associated with more serious health effects.",
      "While scientists are still studying how effective existing COVID-19 vaccines are against the omicron variant, experts said that being vaccinated does not put people at greater risk.",
      "Early indications suggest that omicron might result in milder illness. But it also appears to be highly transmissible. Because hospitalizations and deaths usually lag outbreaks of cases, experts still need time to study the trends.",

      "Among the first 10 studies listed, nearly every one included similar language. One of the studies put it like this: \"Cases tend to be mild, do not usually require specific interventions, and potential risks of the vaccine are outweighed by the well defined risks of COVID-19 infection.\"",

Unvaccinated people had 559 infections, with 47 being from omicron.",

      "There are multiple problems with this claim. It represents a misunderstanding of how the global market operates, and the pressure it\u2019s under today. The current price of a barrel of oil has a lot less to do with the U.S. drilling than the post suggests and a lot more to do with the impact of a global pandemic and a war between Russia and Ukraine. The numbers presented in the post are misleading, energy experts told us.",
      "This means the U.S. is exporting a lot of its domestically produced crude on the international market. To make up for this, the U.S. still must import a substantial amount of oil for domestic use.",
      "Russia on the other hand, accounted for only 7% of the petroleum brought into the U.S. for 2020, with only 540,000 barrels per day. Of that amount, 76,000 barrels were of crude oil, according to the EIA.",
      "In May 2021, the U.S. imported more than 800,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia, according to the U.S. Energy Administration. But the latest figures show a general trend downward and that by October 2021, the figure was 595,000.",

      "The bulk of the oil the U.S. imports from Russia is refined petroleum products, not crude oil. The growth in imports of refined petroleum products from Russia in the past year has not been as steep.",

      "The U.S. imports two types of oil from Russia: crude oil and refined products such as gasoline and kerosene. Last June, the U.S. imported 848,000 barrels per day of crude oil and refined petroleum products from Russia.",

      "\"It\u2019s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production,\" Biden said March 8 in a speech announcing a U.S. ban on Russian oil imports. Biden said that companies pumped more oil in the U.S. during his first year in office than during his predecessor\u2019s first year and that we were on track for record oil production next year. Then Biden pivoted to point the finger at the industry:",
      "\"In the last few years, the U.S. has come very close to producing as much oil as it consumes,\" added Severin Borenstein, the faculty director of the Energy Institute at Haas at the University of California, Berkeley. \"But that does not mean we don't import oil. We still import and export to match crude locations and types most efficiently with refineries.\"",
      "The United States imports some crude oil from Russia, but Russian oil has a relatively small footprint in the U.S. market. Recent data shows Russian imports accounting for about 7% of total U.S. imports; in turn, imports are roughly equal to U.S. crude oil production, making the importance of Russian oil even more modest."

      "The post-COVID-19 inflation story is more complicated than just federal spending. Other forces, including changes in the labor market, rising global energy and commodity prices, supply chain dysfunction and the war in Ukraine have all contributed to higher prices.",

These were predominantly Baltic and Eastern European nations, which have been hit especially hard by the consequences of Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nBut a larger number of OECD members had inflation rates lower than 8.6%, and these include all but one member of the G-7 group, which is limited to the world\u2019s very largest democratic economies.\nAmong the G-7 nations, Germany\u2019s most recent inflation rate was 7.9%, the United Kingdom\u2019s was 7.8%, Italy\u2019s and Canada\u2019s were 6.8%, and France\u2019s was 5.2%.

Many economists say the American Rescue Plan \u2014 the coronavirus relief package that Biden, with only Democratic support in Congress, signed into law shortly after taking office in 2021 \u2014 has contributed to the rise in prices. Critics say putting more money in Americans\u2019 pockets when they didn\u2019t need the assistance has been a contributor to inflation, along with pandemic-related supply-chain troubles and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, both of which have disrupted flows of energy, food and other goods.",
      "Economists generally give Biden some of the blame for the recent high inflation, but not all of it. The American Rescue Plan, a coronavirus relief bill, he signed in 2021 pumped money into Americans\u2019 bank accounts, stimulating demand. But even without that government stimulus, supply shortages were already driving up prices.",
      "For instance, the theory\u2019s inability to explain the U.S. economy since the 1990s may have been because of strong growth in productivity, Burtless said. Productivity gains enabled workers\u2019 wages to grow even as overall costs for employers remained low. This produced the combination of relatively low unemployment and relatively low inflation. Intensifying globalization, which put competitive pressure on U.S. producers to keep price increases small,\u00a0may also have played a role."

      "We\u2019ve reported previously that gas prices are largely caused by the global supply and demand of oil, in addition to international events and inflation. Also, prices are heavily influenced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which controls most of the world\u2019s oil supply.",
      "\"Everyone here knows gas is high because they shut down production in the U.S. but here is an extremely simple breakdown for people with short memories,\" read a March 7",
      "U.S. gas prices have risen under Biden, data shows, but Ernst\u2019s claim suggests that Biden\u2019s policies and his action on Keystone were a driving factor. Yet, gas prices already were on the rise before he took office, due, energy analysts say, to a change in demand following the easing of pandemic restrictions. Meanwhile,\u00a0 the sharpest increases at the pump have come since the start of war in Ukraine.",
      "It was unclear whether this would be enough to lower U.S. gasoline prices, especially if other overseas producers lower their production to cancel out the additional oil, thus keeping supply the same and prices high. But Biden\u2019s presidential predecessor, Donald Trump, issued a statement critical of the move.",
      "\"There is no evidence that Biden has increased oil prices. Instead, what is clear is that the oil industry is making a lot of money and choosing not to invest that money in new production. They don't want to,\" Williams-Derry said. \"And the Biden administration doesn't have many easy legal tools at its disposal to nationalize the oil industry and force companies to produce more.\"",
      "There are multiple problems with this claim. It represents a misunderstanding of how the global market operates, and the pressure it\u2019s under today. The current price of a barrel of oil has a lot less to do with the U.S. drilling than the post suggests and a lot more to do with the impact of a global pandemic and a war between Russia and Ukraine. The numbers presented in the post are misleading, energy experts told us.",
      "\"Current,\" however, is doing a lot of work in Biden\u2019s remarks, which ignore a long run-up of gas-price increases prior to the escalation of military conflict in Ukraine. And while assessments differ over how much the American Rescue Plan promoted inflation generally, the legislation is widely credited with aiding the nation\u2019s economic recovery, which in turn increased demand for gasoline and pushed prices higher.",
      "\"What everyone needs to understand is that the high gas prices are not because of some conflict overseas \u2014 prices were high well before that,\" the post reads. \"The prices are not high because our American supply simply vanished. The prices are high because the people who run our country have decided to import oil from another country instead of using our very own American made product.\"",
      "Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, agreed. \"Biden was definitely overstating the case\" in blaming Putin as the primary driver of high gas prices, Bake said. \"Clearly, the recovery was a factor in gas prices.\"",
      "Oil prices are set on a global market. Any supply disruption, anywhere, affects prices in the U.S.",
      ", gasoline prices initially rose on Biden\u2019s watch because of the recovery after the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. As economic activity, commuting and travel rebounded, fuel demand rose faster than global supplies did.",
      "Indeed, gas prices have fluctuated within and across administrations, with little correlation to which president or party is in power. As with most things, the price of gasoline is determined not by the president, but rather by the state of the economy and the balance of supply and demand. Following our inquiries, Occupy Democrats changed its post to reflect this.",
      "During the interview, Biden said his policies are not to blame. Instead, he pointed to global conditions to show that the United States is not alone in facing such challenges as high oil prices, lagging supply chains during the pandemic, and disruptions from Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "\"This summer, Americans experienced firsthand the devastation Bidenomics has on their wallets,\" Miller said. \"Gas prices have skyrocketed since Joe Biden took office and continue to do so everyday. @HouseGOP will fight Biden\u2019s war on energy to lower costs for hardworking Americans.\""

      "Sharp also pointed to the case of Kjeld Nuis, a Dutch speed skater. Nuis briefly developed pericarditis after receiving Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine but he didn\u2019t collapse during any sporting event and he didn\u2019t say whether his vaccination contributed to his heart problem or whether it was linked to his athletic activity. After experiencing some flu-like symptoms and chest pressure, Nuis said he was examined by his sports doctor and cardiologist.",
      "Another popular example in claims like the one on Instagram is the collapse of Danish soccer player Christian Eriksen. But Eriksen, according to his team director, wasn\u2019t vaccinated for COVID-19 when he suffered cardiac arrest during a match in June 2021.",
      "The German story did not report that all of the athletes had died, did not say they all had heart attacks and included the disclaimer that not all of the people included on the list became ill because of vaccination.",
      "But the same argument can be said for the YouTube video\u2019s title \u2014 that mRNA vaccines offer \"no mortality benefit.\" It\u2019s misleading because it doesn\u2019t specify that the findings are about non-COVID-19 related deaths, that the study is a preprint, or that more research is needed. While scientists like Benn contend that it\u2019s important to study overall mortality effects of vaccines, people received these shots to protect themselves against COVID-19, which these vaccines continue to do.",
      "In Australia, more people died in the first eight months of 2022 from heart-related disease than they typically do in that time frame. Social media posts suggest these deaths were caused by the COVID-19 vaccine."
