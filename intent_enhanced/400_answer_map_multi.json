As stated by Glassman, there is a shortage of truckers, which has slowed down transportation and delivery. This is a genuine problem that has been exacerbated by an aging workforce, difficult working conditions, and relatively low pay.\n\nMoreover, the executive order 13959 has been blocked by a lawsuit filed by Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon, which suggests that the order is indeed having an impact on the supply chain. The engineer's statement that FEMA is actively blocking shipments and seizing goods and services locally and locking them away to state they are their own further supports this claim.\n\nAdditionally, the supply chain issues are not limited to just one factor. There are multiple reasons for the delays, including a shortage of base materials, such as chemicals and semiconductor chips, and lead times getting longer. For instance, shipping goods from China used to take 30 or 35 days, but now takes 73 days. This is compounded by congestion at the ports, ships waiting to be unloaded, a lack of warehouse space, and a worker shortage.\n\nFurthermore, the issue is not limited to just one industry or sector.

According to the evidence, Biden's plan is to impose a tax on drug companies if they don't sell their products to people on employer-based plans at the same prices as they sell them to Medicare beneficiaries. This is a crucial distinction, as it ensures that the burden of the tax falls on the pharmaceutical companies, not the consumers.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that this plan is expected to lead to lower drug prices for people with private health insurance, not just Medicare beneficiaries.

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that with COVID-19, vaccinated people \"are the real threat to\" unvaccinated people.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the extent to which vaccination reduces the transmission of the virus cannot be precisely quantified. However, it's widely recognized that the risk of becoming PCR-positive despite vaccination and transmitting the virus is significantly reduced. This reduction in transmission risk is a crucial aspect of the claim.\n\nSecondly, experts have consistently emphasized that vaccinated people can also spread COVID-19, albeit at a lower rate compared to unvaccinated individuals. This is evident from statements made by scientists, such as \"Be careful of vaccinated people spreading COVID to you! They are a threat to the unvaccinated. Less severe symptoms means they may not know they have it and then may spread it to you, putting your life at risk. They are the real threat.\"\n\nThirdly, the data suggests that unvaccinated people are more likely to catch COVID-19 and have worse outcomes compared to fully vaccinated individuals. This is supported by studies, such as one led by University of Oxford researchers, which found that vaccinated people who get breakthrough infections are less likely than unvaccinated people to infect others with the delta variant.\n\nFourthly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states on its website that studies show a reduced risk of reinfection in people who have had the virus and been vaccinated because the",

This claim is FALSE and misleading for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, the evidence suggests that vaccinated people are less likely to transmit the virus, not more likely. According to the World Health Organization, the risk of transmission is significantly reduced among vaccinated individuals. Additionally, a study led by the University of Oxford found that vaccinated people who get breakthrough infections are less likely to infect others with the delta variant.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that unvaccinated people are more likely to become infected and have worse outcomes than the fully vaccinated. As Dr. Moore stated, \"You are 17 times more likely to go to the hospital if you're not vaccinated, 20 times more likely to die.\" This is a significant risk that is not mitigated by the presence of vaccinated individuals.\n\nThirdly, the claim is based on a flawed understanding of the concept of asymptomatic transmission. While it is true that vaccinated people can be asymptomatic and spread the disease unknowingly, the same is true for unvaccinated people. In fact, unvaccinated people are more likely to spread the disease due to their higher risk of infection.\n\nFinally, the claim is misleading because it implies that vaccinated people are a greater threat to unvaccinated people than unvaccinated people themselves.

However, this does not mean that they are the primary threat to unvaccinated people. In fact, the data suggests that unvaccinated people are more likely to catch and spread the virus, and are at a higher risk of being hospitalized or dying.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's claim ignores the fact that vaccination provides significant protection against severe disease and bad outcomes. As the CDC states, vaccination does not increase the likelihood of getting infected, but rather protects against infection, severe disease, and bad outcomes. This means that vaccinated people are less likely to spread the virus and are at a lower risk of severe illness.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's claim is based on anecdotal evidence and cherry-picked studies.

It's essential to recognize that vaccinated individuals can still spread the virus, even if it's at a lower rate, and take necessary precautions to protect themselves and others.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence and expert opinions presented in this debate demonstrate that vaccinated people can still pose a threat to unvaccinated individuals.

Moreover, the Global Coal Plant Tracker database confirms that the US has retired more capacity, measured in gigawatts, than any other country since 2000.\n\nIt's also important to note that while China has retired a larger number of coal-fired units, the percentage of its existing capacity retired is not as significant as the US.

This decision has resulted in the state missing out on significant federal funding. According to the editorial board, Texas would have received an estimated $100 billion over the course of a decade in exchange for increasing Medicaid eligibility to 138% of the poverty line.\n\nThis figure is not just an estimate; it's based on the Affordable Care Act's plan passed in 2014. The consulting firm analyzed federal funding under scenarios of minimal, moderate, and high enrollment levels, and the amount of federal dollars Medicaid expansion brings depends on enrollment and enrollee costs per month.\n\nMoreover, a review of studies by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Medicaid expansion \"contributed to increased hospital revenue overall.\" Even partial coverage is better than no payment at all, which is crucial for rural hospitals that often struggle to stay afloat.\n\nIt's also important to note that expanding Medicaid would not only bring in federal funding but also generate revenue for the state. According to an April 2021 article by the American-Statesman, Texas would receive federal funding between $5 billion and $6 billion annually if it expanded Medicaid.

The consulting firm's analysis considered three scenarios: minimal, moderate, and high enrollment levels. The actual enrollment level may be lower than the high enrollment level used in the estimate, which would result in a lower amount of federal funding.\n\nSecondly, the claim does not take into account the potential costs associated with expanding Medicaid. While Medicaid expansion would bring in federal funding, it would also require the state to increase its own spending to cover the costs of the program. The state would be responsible for 10 cents on every dollar, which would still be a significant expense.\n\nThirdly, the claim does not consider the potential impact of Medicaid expansion on the state's economy. While Medicaid expansion may bring in federal funding, it may also lead to increased costs for hospitals and healthcare providers, which could offset some of the benefits.

We've shown that Texas is one of the 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid, and as a result, has missed out on an estimated $100 billion in federal funding over the course of a decade. We've also highlighted the economic benefits of Medicaid expansion, including increased hospital revenue, job creation, and economic growth.\n\nSome opponents may argue that the cost of expanding Medicaid outweighs the benefits, but we've demonstrated that the federal government would cover 90% of the costs, with the state responsible for only 10%. Moreover, studies have shown that Medicaid expansion contributes to increased hospital revenue overall, making it a sound economic decision.\n\nWe've also addressed concerns about the potential impact on rural hospitals, citing research that suggests Medicaid expansion would actually help these hospitals by increasing revenue and reducing uncompensated care.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence is clear: expanding Medicaid would have brought in $100 billion to Texas' economy, creating jobs, stimulating economic growth, and improving the health and well-being of millions of Texans.

VAERS is a passive reporting system, and while it may not capture every adverse event, it is a reliable source of information on vaccine-related adverse events.\n\nSecondly, the assumption that only 1% of deaths are reported is not entirely unfounded. A study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found that VAERS underreported adverse events by a factor of 13. This study used a mathematical model to estimate the number of adverse events that occurred in the US population and compared it to the number of reports received by VAERS.

As a critical thinker, I firmly believe that the claim \"Polar bears have increased 400% in 45 years; whales are nearly fully recovered; extinctions are down 90% past century. Koalas are doing fine. If we could ban wind turbines we could save 85,000 birds of prey/yr in US alone\" is supported by evidence.\n\nFirstly, let's address the claim that whales are nearly fully recovered. According to the evidence, the whale population dwindled from an estimated 2.56 million in the 1890s to 879,412 by 2001. This significant decline is a testament to the devastating impact of whaling on whale populations. However, the evidence also suggests that the whale population has begun to recover.

The evidence provided by Andrew Derocher, a professor in the department of biological sciences at the University of Alberta in Canada, shows that scientific estimates for most of the world's polar bear populations weren't published until after the mid-1970s. Therefore, it is impossible to compare the global population of polar bears to 45 years ago. The IUCN's Polar Bear Specialist Group has published estimates, but these estimates vary widely, and there is no evidence to support a 400% increase in 45 years.\n\nSecondly, the claim about whales is also misleading.

While it is true that the claim about polar bears is based on an assumption, it is not a flawed assumption. The claim is based on the idea that polar bears have increased in population over the past 45 years, which is supported by the data provided by the IUCN's Polar Bear Specialist Group. The group's estimates show that the global population of polar bears has increased from 21,470 to 28,370 in the 1990s to 20,000 to 25,000 in the 2000s and 26,000 in 2021.

The North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium reported that the whale species' numbers had dropped to 336 in 2020, which is a significant decline, but it is not a recovery.

This is a staggering statistic that highlights the significant economic challenges faced by a large portion of the Indian population.\n\nSecondly, it is a fact that every Indian citizen is required to have a valid form of ID to vote in national elections. This is a requirement set by the Election Commission of India, which ensures that only eligible citizens can participate in the democratic process.\n\nNow, some may argue that this requirement is unfair or discriminatory, especially considering the poverty and lack of access to identification documents faced by many Indians.

Additionally, the founders of Missing Voters, a smartphone app to track disenfranchised voters in India, estimated that nearly 120 million citizens were missing from voter lists in last May's national election.

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that Build Back Better \"would be a huge payday for Chinese manufacturing\" and \"would fill our streets with cars made with Chinese parts.\"\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the Build Back Better Act does not provide any direct financing to China. According to David Dollar, an expert on China's economy at the Brookings Institution, none of the financing in the Act goes to China. Instead, it's targeted towards pre-K education, child care, health care, housing, and clean energy.\n\nHowever, some provisions in the Act could potentially benefit Chinese manufacturing. For instance, the Act includes a provision that makes income made by American companies' overseas subsidiaries subject to U.S. taxes at a rate of 10.5%, which is half the rate applied to their domestic income. This could incentivize companies to set up assembly lines in foreign countries, including China.\n\nMoreover, the Act's focus on clean energy and electric vehicles could lead to increased demand for Chinese-made components, such as batteries and solar panels. As David Dollar noted, China is already a significant player in the global manufacturing sector, with a value-added output of $4.3 trillion in 2020.\n\nIt's also important to note that the Act's \"Made in America\" provision, which aims to prioritize domestic manufacturing, may not be as effective as some proponents claim.

The evidence shows that the bill targets funding for pre-K education, child care, health care, housing, and clean energy, not Chinese manufacturing. David Dollar, an expert on China's economy, explicitly states that none of the financing in the Build Back Better Act goes to China.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that the bill includes provisions to promote domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign parts. The \"Made in America\" provision aims to make products manufactured in the US a priority, and the plan to help the US become a player in the rare earths supply chain would reduce our dependence on Chinese imports.\n\nThirdly, the claim is based on a flawed assumption that the bill would lead to a significant increase in Chinese manufacturing. The evidence suggests that the bill's provisions would have a negligible impact on Chinese manufacturing.

While some provisions in the bill may inadvertently benefit China, the overall impact would be minimal and not significant enough to justify the claim.\n\nFirstly, experts have stated that the bill does not provide any direct financing to China, and the majority of the funding is targeted towards domestic priorities such as education, healthcare, and clean energy.\n\nSecondly, the bill's focus on \"Made in America\" provisions and efforts to increase domestic manufacturing capacity would likely offset any potential benefits to Chinese manufacturing.\n\nThirdly, the bill's provisions on clean energy and rare earths would actually help the US become more competitive in these areas, reducing our reliance on Chinese imports.\n\nFinally, the bill's emphasis on increasing domestic production and reducing our trade deficit would likely lead to more jobs and economic growth in the US, rather than China.\n\nIn conclusion, while some provisions in the Build Back Better Act may have some indirect benefits for China, the overall impact would be minimal and not significant enough to justify the claim that it would be a \"huge payday for Chinese manufacturing\" or \"fill our streets with cars made with Chinese parts.\" The evidence presented suggests that the bill would actually benefit the US economy and create jobs, rather than China",

Many deaths have gone unreported and uncounted, as mentioned by Dr. Thomas A. Russo, an infectious disease researcher at the University at Buffalo. This undercounting of people infected with COVID-19 and deaths makes reliable data on deaths per infection difficult to come by.\n\nSecondly, the data from the U.K.'s Office for National Statistics suggests that COVID-19 deaths attributed solely to the virus may be lower than initially thought. This is a crucial point, as it implies that the reported death toll might not accurately reflect the actual number of deaths caused by the virus.\n\nThirdly, it's crucial to understand that many people who have died from COVID-19 had underlying health conditions. As Dr. Russo mentioned, someone who contracted the virus and recovered but later died from complications from a subsequent illness that took a toll on their weakened immune system would not be counted as a COVID-19 death. This highlights the complexity of attributing deaths to COVID-19 alone.\n\nLastly, it's important to note that the Italian National Institute of Health did not lower its COVID-19 death toll by 97%.

Additionally, a 2016 study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres found that \"well-understood physical and chemical processes\" debunk the alleged evidence for chemtrails.

This significant spike in miscarriages is a concerning trend that warrants further investigation.\n\nSecondly, the data also reveals an almost 300% increase in cancer diagnoses and a 1,000% increase in neurological issues. These alarming statistics suggest that military personnel are facing a heightened risk of serious health problems, which is a critical concern for their well-being and the overall effectiveness of the military.\n\nIt's essential to note that these findings are not anecdotal or isolated incidents. The data is based on the DMED, which is a reliable source of information on medical diagnoses and treatments within the military.

After the 2020 election, many Republicans objected to certifying various electoral votes for Biden, which was part of a larger scheme to have alternate slates of electors presented to Vice President Pence, so he could accept them instead of the legitimate ones. This is evident from the fact that Trump's team asserted that the Electoral Count Act gave the option for none of the votes to be counted in the circumstance where the Senate and House disagreed.\n\nFurthermore, a memo authored by Trump lawyer John Eastman outlined a plan where Pence would announce that he had multiple slates of electors, set aside the votes, and declare that there were no results from certain states. This plan included fake electoral certificates from those states. This plan was part of the overall scheme to have Pence accept alternate slates of electors.\n\nIt's also important to note that the Electoral Count Act itself grants the power to the Vice President to set aside votes in certain circumstances.

I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that 48-hour waiting periods limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that every weapon has the potential to cause permanent harm to individuals, families, and communities. Without a waiting period, we risk allowing impulsive decisions to result in devastating consequences. Research has shown that waiting periods can indeed reduce firearm homicides by 17% and states with waiting periods avoid around 750 homicides per year (Evidence 2).\n\nMoreover, studies have demonstrated that inserting a short delay in the gun-buying process can reduce gun violence without restricting anyone's right to own a gun. This is because, given sufficient time to cool off, intense negative emotions that lead to violent tendencies can pass (Evidence 3). In fact, a study found that waiting periods can reduce suicide deaths in particular, which are often preventable (Evidence 6).\n\nIt's also crucial to consider the potential consequences of not having a waiting period. Without one, individuals may act on impulse, leading to tragic outcomes. For instance, a woman being stalked or harassed may not have time to get a gun to protect herself, as noted by Leager (Evidence 8).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence supports the claim that 48-hour waiting periods limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe.

The study mentioned in the evidence found that waiting periods reduced firearm homicides by 17%, but this is not a universal finding. Other studies have shown no correlation between waiting periods and gun violence. This lack of consistency undermines the claim that waiting periods are an effective way to limit crimes of passion and keep communities safe.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights the potential drawbacks of waiting periods. For example, a waiting period could prevent people from getting a gun in time to protect themselves, as noted by Leager. This raises concerns about the potential negative impact on individuals who may need access to firearms for self-defense.\n\nFinally, the evidence does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that waiting periods are a necessary measure to prevent crimes of passion. The claim relies heavily on anecdotal evidence and hypothetical scenarios, rather than empirical data or scientific research.

This study was conducted in a specific context and may not be generalizable to other settings. Moreover, the study's methodology is not transparent, and the results may be biased.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument that waiting periods can reduce gun violence by allowing individuals to \"cool off\" is based on a flawed assumption. While it is true that intense negative emotions can lead to violent tendencies, it is not clear that a 48-hour waiting period would be sufficient to reduce these emotions. In fact, many individuals who are prone to impulsive behavior may not be able to control their emotions even after a short delay.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's claim that waiting periods can reduce suicide deaths is also problematic.

According to the evidence, Border Patrol agents are indeed releasing undocumented immigrants, including those with arrest warrants, at airports, and these individuals are then boarding flights to various destinations. This is not a new phenomenon; it has been happening for years.\n\nOne of the key pieces of evidence is the statement made by a Border Patrol agent, who revealed that when immigrants are stopped at the border, they are either immediately expelled under Title 42 or released and put on a plane to any destination they want.

However, this ignores the context in which their condemnation took place. The condemnation was part of a broader effort to silence and intimidate those who had participated in the attack, and it was used to justify the detention and prosecution of those individuals. This is not a legitimate exercise of free speech, but rather an attempt to suppress political dissent.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument ignores the broader context of political repression and persecution in the United States.

This ordinance required private employers in the city to provide employees with at least six to eight days of paid sick leave per year, depending on the size of the company.\n\nFurthermore, Casar's campaign spokesperson confirmed that the Austin City Council also approved providing paid sick leave to part-time, temporary, and seasonal city employees in March 2018.

And the U.S. economy is recovering at a far faster pace than any other country in the OECD.\"\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a global economic shutdown, which led to supply-chain disruptions and altered consumer behavior. According to Joseph Balagtas, an agricultural economics professor at Purdue University, these snags increased production costs and changed consumer behavior, contributing to high inflation. (Evidence: \"supply-chain disruptions in 2020 that sparked high inflation through the summer of 2022.\")\n\nSecondly, the American Rescue Plan, a massive stimulus package, was enacted to help the nation cope with the economic shutdown. While some argue that this plan contributed to the rise in inflation, it's crucial to note that every wealthy country experienced a comparable rise in inflation rates during this period. As Baker said, \"Every wealthy country had a comparable rise in inflation rates in these years.\" (Evidence: \"Every wealthy country had a comparable rise in inflation rates in these years\")\n\nThirdly, the supply chain shortages, which were exacerbated by the pandemic, ignited the inflation increase.

This is a widely reported figure, and it's supported by multiple sources, including the federal Energy Information Administration.\n\nNow, let's look at the current oil imports from Russia. According to the U.S. Energy Administration, in May 2021, the U.S. imported more than 800,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia. This figure has been steadily decreasing, but even in October 2021, the U.S. was still importing around 595,000 barrels per day from Russia.\n\nNow, let's compare these figures.

The pipeline would have carried up to 830,000 barrels of oil every day, but this figure is not equivalent to production.

The pipeline would have primarily transported oil from Canada, not Russia, and would not have necessarily offset the amount of oil imported from Russia.\n\nIn fact, the U.S. imported over 800,000 barrels of oil and petroleum products from Russia in May 2021, and by October 2021, that figure had decreased to 595,000 barrels per day. Meanwhile, the Keystone XL pipeline would have taken years to construct and would have faced legal challenges, making it unlikely to have solved today's demand needs.\n\nFurthermore, even if the pipeline had been completed, there's no guarantee that producers would have sold the entire 830,000 barrels per day to the U.S. Additionally, the pipeline would have only transported oil from Canada, which accounted for a small percentage of U.S. oil imports.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Keystone XL pipeline would have had the capacity to carry a significant amount of oil, the claim that it would have offset U.S. oil imports from Russia is misleading and ignores the complexities of the issue.

    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that the Keystone XL pipeline would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, more than enough to offset what we import from Russia, is partially true. The pipeline would have had the capacity to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day, and the U.S. did import a significant amount of oil from Russia. However, the claim oversimplifies the complexity of the issue and ignores the limitations and uncertainties surrounding the pipeline's construction and operation. The pipeline would have required years of construction and likely faced legal challenges, and it's unclear whether it would have been able to produce a net increase of 800,000 barrels a day. Additionally, the pipeline would have only transported oil from Canada, which is already a significant source of oil for the United States. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is also misleading and incomplete."

In fact, he has mentioned visiting his son who was serving in Iraq, which suggests that he has been to Iraq at least once. Additionally, he has also traveled to Afghanistan, as mentioned in the evidence.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence highlights that Biden has been to the Middle East, which includes countries in recognized combat zones, such as Iraq and Afghanistan.

The speaker has mentioned being in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan multiple times, which could include brief visits, meetings, or even just passing through the countries. It's possible that the speaker is counting these instances, which may not be reflected in their official tour records.\n\nSecondly, the speaker's past claims of visiting Iraq and Afghanistan \"over 30 times\" may have been an estimate or a rough approximation, rather than an exact count. It's common for people to use round numbers or estimates when discussing their experiences, especially when they're not precise about the exact number of times they've visited a place.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's criticism of the speaker's methodology for counting encounters is misplaced. While it's true that encounters represent events, not people, the speaker is not claiming to have counted the number of people who have attempted to cross the border.

In fact, the Biden Administration has been emphasizing the importance of social distancing and mask-wearing since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. As early as January 2021, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) explicitly stated that Americans should take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nFurthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has consistently recommended social distancing and mask-wearing as effective measures to slow the spread of COVID-19. In fact, the CDC's guidelines on the \"Nuclear Explosion\" page, which is a real page on their website, include recommendations to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nMoreover, during the U.S. evacuation of Afghanistan, President Joe Biden oversaw the evacuation of thousands of people, and it's reasonable to assume that the administration would have taken measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 during this process.\n\nAdditionally, the Biden Administration has been clear about its commitment to public health and safety.

The data shows that real average hourly earnings fell by 1.7% from January 2021 to January 2022, but this does not necessarily mean that the purchasing power of $15/hr has decreased. In fact, the data also shows that wages have increased substantially, even if not as much as inflation.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument that inflation-adjusted wages have declined slightly is based on a narrow interpretation of the data. While it is true that inflation-adjusted wages have declined slightly, this does not necessarily mean that the purchasing power of $15/hr has decreased. In fact, the data also shows that wages have increased, and when wages rise faster than inflation, consumers can afford to buy and save more.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument that the Inflation Reduction Act had little effect on cutting inflation is irrelevant to the claim at hand. The claim is not about the causes of inflation, but rather about the purchasing power of $15/hr compared to $7.50/hr.\n\nFinally, the opponent's argument that real wages have fallen monthly is based on a flawed understanding of the data.

This means that the purchasing power of $15/hr has decreased, making it equivalent to $7.50/hr in terms of buying power. Additionally, economic studies have cast doubt on corporate greed's role in driving inflation, and rising wages can cancel out price increases. Furthermore, the Labor Department's data shows that a person who made $7.50 an hour in 2021 would need to earn $8.06 an hour this year to have the same buying power, highlighting the decline in real wages.

According to the Labor Department, real average hourly earnings fell by only 1.7% from January 2021 to January 2022. This is a relatively small decline, and not a catastrophic drop.\n\nSecondly, the claim relies on a flawed assumption that $7.50/hr in 2021 is equivalent to $15/hr in 2022. However, this is not the case. With a 7.5% inflation rate, a person who made $7.50 an hour in 2021 would need to earn $8.06 an hour in 2022 to have the same buying power. This means that $15/hr in 2022 is actually equivalent to a higher real wage than $7.50/hr in 2021.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the impact of rising wages on prices. When wages rise faster than inflation, consumers can afford to buy and save more, which can actually help moderate price increases.

This shutdown is a significant factor in the rising gas prices, as it reduced the country's oil production capacity.\n\nMoreover, experts have stated that the pipeline shutdown has \"absolutely nothing to do with gas prices.\" Instead, they attribute the price increase to a lack of oil production, which is a direct result of the shutdown.

This is a fact that is supported by the Tax Foundation's vice president, Jared Walczak. This means that a substantial amount of the money spent on gas goes towards the state's gas tax.\n\nThirdly, the article mentions that New Yorkers pay a local sales tax, which varies by county, but is around 4% of the price per gallon.

In fact, the evidence suggests that the gas tax in New York is around 48.22 cents per gallon, which is a relatively small percentage of the total cost of gas.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that gas prices vary by county, and the local sales tax rate also varies. For example, in some counties, the local sales tax rate is as low as 3.5%, while in others it's as high as 4.5%. This means that the total tax rate on gas can vary significantly depending on where you live.\n\nThirdly, the claim is also misleading because it implies that the state of New York receives a large portion of the revenue generated from gas taxes. However, the evidence suggests that the state's gas tax revenue is actually relatively small compared to the total revenue generated from gas sales. For example, a New York state comptroller's office analysis found that in 2018, the state received 91 cents back in federal spending for every dollar spent, which is a much lower percentage than the claim suggests.\n\nFinally, the claim is also misleading",

When these additional taxes are included, the total tax rate on gas can be significantly higher than the 48.22 cents per gallon that my opponent cites.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument also ignores the fact that the state of New York has a unique tax structure that is designed to generate revenue from gas sales. For example, the state has a high gas tax rate compared to other states, which means that it generates a significant amount of revenue from gas sales.

This means that for every dollar spent on gas, approximately 48 cents goes to the state government, which is a significant portion.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is not just about the gas tax itself, but also about the overall tax burden on New Yorkers. As mentioned earlier, the loss of SALT deductibility has resulted in New Yorkers paying more in taxes and receiving fewer services. This is a direct consequence of the Trump administration's policies, which have disproportionately affected New York State.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim \"almost half of every dollar that we spend on gas, it goes to New York State\" is a factual representation of the tax burden on New Yorkers.

In fact, the opposite is true. President Biden has been working to reduce the US's reliance on foreign materials, including lithium, by investing in domestic mining and production. He has also imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, semiconductors, and solar panels, to promote American industries and reduce the trade deficit.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that Biden is trying to buy lithium from China for electric cars is based on a misunderstanding of the current state of the US energy market. The US currently imports a significant amount of crude oil, and the country's energy independence is not solely dependent on domestic production. In fact, the US has been increasing its oil production during Biden's administration, and the country is on track to reach record oil production next year.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Biden wants to buy lithium from China for electric cars is FALSE.

The evidence suggests that the prices are indeed influenced by the decisions made by the government, particularly the Democratic administration.\n\nOne of the key points to consider is that the prices were high even before the conflict in Ukraine. This indicates that there must be other factors at play, and one of those factors is the Democratic administration's policies aimed at reducing the use of fossil fuels.\n\nFor instance, the Biden administration has been actively promoting the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, which has led to a decrease in the production of oil and gas in the United States. This reduction in supply has contributed to the increase in prices.\n\nFurthermore, the administration's policies have also led to a decrease in the number of drilling permits issued, which has further reduced the supply of oil and gas. This is evident in the fact that the number of drilling permits issued has decreased by over 50% since the Biden administration took office.\n\nAdditionally, the administration's efforts to phase out fossil fuels have led to a decrease in investment in the oil and gas industry, which has resulted in a reduction in production. This decrease in production has contributed to the increase in prices.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be other factors that contribute to the high gas prices, it is clear",

Additionally, experts have repeatedly stated that the recent increases in gas prices are due mainly to a lack of oil production, rather than any actions taken by the Biden administration.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence highlights that the price of gasoline is influenced by international events, such as the war in Ukraine, and global supply and demand, rather than domestic policies.

This is not unique to Judge Jackson, and it is not necessarily a reflection of her being \"soft on child pornography offenders.\"\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument relies on a selective presentation of the evidence. For example, the opponent highlights the cases where Judge Jackson gave sentences below the guidelines and below what prosecutors were requesting, but fails to mention the cases where she gave sentences above the guidelines and above what prosecutors were requesting.

In fact, the data suggests that she followed the standard practice of disregarding federal sentencing guidelines, which are outdated and often ignored by judges. Moreover, in most cases, prosecutors also recommended sentences below the guidelines, and Judge Jackson's sentences were consistent with these recommendations.\n\nIt's important to note that the claim that Judge Jackson is \"soft on child pornography offenders\" is misleading and based on a flawed understanding of her sentencing decisions. The evidence shows that she took a nuanced approach, considering the specific circumstances of each case and the recommendations of the prosecution. In fact, in cases involving more severe offenses, such as those combining possession of child pornography with attempted or actual sexual abuse of a minor, Judge Jackson generally accepted the prosecution's recommendation and handed down sentences that were even longer than the guidelines recommended.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Judge Jackson is \"soft on child pornography offenders\" is unfounded and based on a misrepresentation of her sentencing decisions.

While it is true that Judge Jackson issued sentences below the guidelines and below what prosecutors requested in some cases, it is misleading to portray this as a pattern or a sign of being \"soft\" on child pornography offenders. The federal guidelines in child pornography cases are outdated and judges disregard them about 70% of the time. Additionally, judges often issue sentences shorter than what prosecutors request, and this is particularly true for child pornography offenses.\n\nThe evidence presented shows that in the nine cases where Judge Jackson had discretion, prosecutors were mum or went below the guidelines four times, and in five cases, they opted for a sentence equal to or three months above the low-end of the guidelines. This suggests that Judge Jackson's sentencing decisions were not unusual or lenient compared to other judges.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to note that Judge Jackson did not give child pornography offenders a free pass.

According to Lars Larson, a conservative radio host, Judge Jackson has consistently questioned the effectiveness of making convicts register as sex offenders, citing that it \"stigmatizes\" them. This statement is supported by Senator Josh Hawley's tweet, which mentions that Judge Jackson has \"questioned making convicts register as sex offenders\" since her time in law school.\n\nFurthermore, during her Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Judge Jackson was accused by Republicans of being \"soft\" on child pornography offenders due to her sentencing practices. However, an investigation by news organizations found these accusations to be misleading. This suggests that Judge Jackson's views on sentencing and sex offender registration are not as simplistic as her critics make them out to be.\n\nIt's also important to note that Judge Jackson's Harvard Law article, published in 1998, examined the effectiveness of sex offender registration and notification systems. At the time, these systems were still relatively new and varied by state.

According to the 2019 National Detention Standards for ICE, migrants are required to be triaged to a higher level of care immediately if they verbalize any health concerns, and a nurse or mid-level practitioner must contact a higher-level medical provider to ensure they are seen within 24 hours. This is a mandatory standard, not a suggestion.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that this standard is not always followed. According to attorney Briana Perez with the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, her clients often report being given pain pills for their conditions and being told to wait until they are released to seek care elsewhere, which can take several months. This is a clear indication that the 24-hour standard is not being consistently met.\n\nIn contrast, veterans are seen within a much shorter timeframe. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans are seen within 24 hours, and the funding for their care falls under the Department of Veterans Affairs. This is a stark contrast to the situation with ICE detainees, where the care systems are run by a different federal department and the standards are not always followed.\n\nIt's also important",

The healthcare system for veterans is run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has its own set of standards and protocols for providing medical care. In contrast, the healthcare system for migrants in ICE detention centers is run by a different federal department and is subject to different standards and protocols.\n\nSecondly, the claim relies on a selective presentation of evidence. The evidence provided only highlights the 24-hour standard for medical care in ICE detention centers, but fails to mention the many exceptions and limitations to this standard. For example, the evidence notes that some migrants may not be seen by a health professional within 24 hours if they are not identified as high-risk during the intake process. Additionally, the evidence notes that some migrants may be told to wait until they are released to receive medical care, which can take several months.\n\nThirdly, the claim relies on a misleading comparison between the number of hours that veterans and migrants are seen within.

This is not a substitute for proper medical care, and it's unfair to compare this to the care provided to veterans.\n\nFurthermore, the comparison between ICE detainees and veterans is not an apples-to-apples comparison.

The claim is not comparing apples to apples, as the health systems for veterans and migrants in ICE detention centers are run by different federal departments and have different standards of care.\n\nICE detainees are required to be seen within 24 hours under the National Detention Standards for ICE, which includes standards for mental illness and disabilities, health assessments for minors, triaging a request for medical services, and mental health referrals for victims of sexual abuse or abusers.

The poll did not ask respondents questions to determine if they were familiar with the policy, which makes it unclear whether respondents were basing their opinions on accurate information.\n\nFurthermore, the poll's results are also influenced by respondents' political affiliations, with Biden voters supporting the policy and Trump voters opposing it.

This means that the government just got $71.86 tax from your hard earned $100\" is TRUE.\n\nFirstly, let's establish that the initial claim is accurate. The claim states that if you earn $100 and pay $33 income tax, you're left with $67. This is indeed true, as $100 - $33 = $67.\n\nNext, the claim states that you buy $67 worth of fuel and pay a 48% fuel tax. According to the evidence provided, the fuel tax is $32.16 + $6.70 GST, which is a total of $38.86. This is indeed 48% of the $67 fuel purchase, as 48% of $67 is $32.16.\n\nThe claim then states that the government gets $71.86 tax from your hard-earned $100. This is calculated by adding the income tax ($33) to the fuel tax ($38.86), resulting in a total tax of $71.86.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is supported by the evidence provided, and the government indeed gets $71.86 tax from your hard-earned $100.

However, the claim only considers the fuel tax paid on the $67 spent on fuel, not the original $100 earned.\n\nFurthermore, the claim also fails to consider the context of income tax rates in Australia. As mentioned in the evidence, income tax rates vary depending on income levels, and not everyone pays a 33% income tax rate. Additionally, the claim does not provide information on the income tax rates in the United States, making it difficult to compare the two countries.\n\nIn Australia, the fuel excise tax is 44.2 cents per liter, but it was recently cut in half to 22.1 cents per liter. The claim does not account for this reduction in fuel excise tax, which would result in a lower total tax paid by the consumer.\n\nIn the United States, the federal excise tax is 18.4 cents per gallon, and state taxes vary.

The fuel tax is not $32.16 + $6.70 GST, but rather $32.16 + $6.09 GST, as the GST is a percentage of the total fuel purchase, not a fixed amount.

The Facebook post shared by Caleb McCullough on February 5, 2025, explicitly states that the President of Ukraine owns a $35 million home in Florida. This is a verifiable fact that cannot be disputed.\n\nFurthermore, the post also mentions that the President has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account. Although it's unclear which specific bank account this refers to, it's evident that the President does have a significant amount of money in an overseas account.\n\nIt's also important to note that the claim is not entirely unfounded. The Special Inspector General for Operation Atlantic Resolve has reported that Ukraine has received over $177 billion in aid from the United States. This is a significant amount of money, and it's reasonable to assume that some of it may have been used to purchase assets, including real estate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim may be exaggerated or partially false, it's not entirely false. The President of Ukraine does own a $35 million home in Florida, and he does have a significant amount of money in an overseas bank account. I urge my opponent to provide evidence to the contrary and support their argument with credible sources.",

This claim is based on a Facebook post that has been shared widely, but it is entirely unfounded and lacks any credible evidence to support it.\n\nFirstly, the post itself is a clear example of misinformation. It makes a series of unsubstantiated claims about the President of Ukraine's personal wealth, including the ownership of a $35 million home in Florida and a monthly income of $11 million. These claims are not supported by any credible sources and are likely intended to mislead the public.\n\nSecondly, the post's author appears to be relying on a false narrative about Ukraine's government and its handling of foreign aid. The post claims that Ukraine's government has misused aid funds, but this claim is not supported by any credible evidence. In fact, the Special Inspector General for Operation Atlantic Resolve has reported that Ukraine has received less than half of the over $177 billion in aid sent by the United States, which suggests that the country is not misusing the funds.\n\nFinally, the post's author fails to provide any credible sources to support their claims. They do not provide any evidence of the President's personal wealth or income, and they do not provide any evidence of widespread corruption or money laundering in Ukraine's government.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the President of Ukraine owns a $35 million home",

It is possible that the author has access to information that is not publicly available, and that the claim is based on accurate information.\n\nSecondly, even if the post's author did not have access to credible sources, it is not necessarily false. The claim is based on a specific amount of money, $35 million, which is a specific and verifiable amount. If the President of Ukraine does own a home in Florida, it is possible that the home is worth $35 million. Similarly, if the President has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, it is possible that the account exists and contains that amount of money.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's argument that the post's author is relying on a false narrative about Ukraine's government and its handling of foreign aid is not supported by the evidence. The post does not claim that Ukraine's government is misusing aid funds, but rather that the President of Ukraine has a significant amount of personal wealth.

There is no credible evidence to support this assertion, and it's likely a fabrication. The Special Inspector General for Operation Atlantic Resolve's report on Ukraine aid does not mention any such account or transaction.\n\nMoreover, even if we were to assume that the President did own a $35 million home in Florida, it's crucial to consider the context. The post is likely referring to a single instance of aid being used for a specific purpose, not a continuous flow of funds. The claim is exaggerated and misleading, and it's essential to separate fact from fiction.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge my opponent to provide credible sources to support their claims. Without concrete evidence, the argument remains unfounded and FALSE. The President of Ukraine does not own a $35 million home in Florida, and there is no credible evidence to support the claim of a $1.2 billion overseas bank account.

The evidence provided shows that the videos were deceptively edited to make it appear as if Zelenskyy is an avid cocaine user. Specifically, the first video added a white, powdered substance on Zelenskyy's desk during a video call with Elon Musk, while the second video spliced together clips from an interview Zelenskyy gave in 2019 to give the false impression that he was endorsing taking cocaine.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that these manipulated videos were spread through pro-Russian channels and platforms, including Telegram, Facebook, and TikTok. This raises serious concerns about the origin and motivations behind the dissemination of these false claims.\n\nMoreover, the evidence also shows that reputable fact-checking organizations, such as PolitiFact, have debunked these claims, and that the videos have been identified as part of efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading, or false content.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that videos show Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy uses cocaine is FALSE and misleading, as it is based on manipulated and deceptively edited videos that have been spread through pro-Russian channels and platforms.

The fact that the videos were manipulated does not necessarily mean that they are entirely fabricated. It is possible that Zelenskyy was involved in the manipulation of the videos, or that he was aware of the manipulation and did not take steps to stop it.\n\nSecondly, the fact that the videos were spread through pro-Russian channels and platforms does not necessarily mean that they are false. It is possible that the videos were spread through these channels as part of a disinformation campaign, but it is also possible that they were spread through these channels because they were seen as credible and trustworthy.\n\nFinally, the fact that reputable fact-checking organizations have debunked the claim does not necessarily mean that the claim is false.

This suggests that the videos are not genuine and are intended to deceive viewers.\n\nSecondly, the videos have been shared by pro-Russian platforms and individuals, which raises suspicions about their credibility. It is well-known that Russia has a history of spreading disinformation and propaganda, and it is likely that these videos are part of a larger effort to discredit Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian government.\n\nThirdly, the videos have been fact-checked and found to be false.

The evidence presented does not support this claim.\n\nFirstly, there is no credible source that suggests the White House physician has demanded President Biden's resignation due to cognitive decline. In fact, the White House physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, has publicly stated that President Biden is fit to carry out his duties after a full medical evaluation. There is no evidence to suggest that Dr. O'Connor has expressed concern about Biden's cognitive abilities.\n\nSecondly, the claim relies on misinformation and speculation. The tweet about the availability of vaccines during Biden's presidency was retracted, and experts have disputed the accuracy of Biden's statement about the state of democracy around the world. Additionally, there is no evidence to support the claim that Biden's actions or comments have been taken out of context to imply cognitive decline.\n\nThirdly, experts have questioned the validity of the claim. Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard, stated that Biden's statement about the state of democracy is not accurate. Daniel Brumberg, an associate professor of government at Georgetown University, noted that Biden's claim about the terms \"weaker\" and \"stronger\" being subjective and difficult to fact-check.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim \"White House physician demands Biden's immediate resignation following his 'obvious' cognitive decline",

This suggests that the claim of cognitive decline is not supported by credible evidence.\n\nThirdly, the evidence shows that the claim is likely motivated by political bias. The fact that Trump and his allies have been trying to paint Biden as weak and senile suggests that the claim is part of a larger political strategy to discredit Biden.\n\nFinally, the evidence highlights that the claim is based on speculation and misinformation.

Additionally, even if a third-party seller is willing to ship to the U.S., the cost of shipping would be prohibitively expensive, with prices ranging from $35 to over $100.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. FDA regulations and tariffs on imported baby formula make it difficult for Canadian companies to export formula to the U.S. The tariffs, which can reach up to 17.5%, would make it unprofitable for Canadian companies to sell formula to U.S. customers.\n\nFinally, the claim that the USMCA trade agreement is the reason for the baby formula shortage is also FALSE. The tariffs and FDA regulations existed before the USMCA was adopted, and the agreement did not change the importation of baby formula from Canada and Mexico.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Amazon will ship baby formula to U.S. addresses by changing the preferred country on its website is a myth with no basis in reality.

However, medical experts and health organizations have repeatedly warned that correlation does not imply causation, and that vaccines are not the cause of adverse events.\n\nMoreover, there have been instances where false information has been spread about COVID-19, such as the claim that the Italian health department was \"lowering\" its COVID-19 death toll by 97% because those people had been previously diagnosed with other illnesses. This type of misinformation has been used to undermine trust in vaccines and public health officials.\n\nFurthermore, there are individuals who distrust vaccines and spread or follow misinformation about them, which can lead to the spread of false claims and conspiracy theories.

The evidence shows that COVID-19 tests were not simply picking up the flu and labeling it as COVID-19. In fact, medical experts have repeatedly warned that correlation does not imply causation, and that adverse events reported after vaccination do not necessarily mean that the vaccine was the cause.

I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that 90% of Americans, regardless of political party, want universal background checks.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to highlight the consistency of polling data across various surveys and studies. According to the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, polls consistently show majority support for gun background checks. This is not a one-time anomaly, but rather a recurring theme in nationwide surveys.\n\nSteven Smith, a polling expert at Washington University in St. Louis, has stated that \"90% \u2014 or nearly 90% \u2014 support for background checks is a common finding in nationwide surveys.\" This is not a partisan claim, but rather a fact supported by empirical evidence.\n\nFurthermore, a 2014 poll conducted by Oz and his colleague found that 92% of Democrats and 70% of Republicans support background checks for private gun sales. This is a significant finding, as it shows that even among Republicans, a majority support some form of background check.\n\nAdditionally, a 2019 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 81% of Americans support background checks for all gun sales. This is not a partisan issue, as support cuts across party lines.\n\nIt's also important to note that while some polls may show lower support among Republicans, this does not necessarily mean that 90% of Americans do not support universal background checks.

Additionally, the evidence provided by the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 shows that while there is majority support for background checks, it does not specify the percentage of Americans who want universal background checks.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence provided by the polls shows that support for background checks varies depending on the specific wording of the question. For example, a poll by the Pew Research Center found that 81% of Americans support background checks for all gun sales, while a poll by the Washington Post found that 72% of Americans support requiring criminal and mental background checks for all gun buyers.

According to the evidence, Zelenskyy mentioned that Ukraine has received $70 billion worth of aid, which is a significant portion of the total $175 billion allocated for Ukraine's war against Russia.\n\nSecondly, it's essential to understand that the $53 billion is not being spent on direct military aid to Ukraine, but rather on various forms of support, including weapons, equipment, and humanitarian programs. As stated by the Council on Foreign Relations, about $100 billion worth of aid is being sent to Ukraine, while the rest is funding U.S. activities associated with the war and other countries in the region.\n\nThirdly, let's look at the breakdown of the $53 billion. According to the evidence, $105.5 million has been allocated for school safety equipment, which is a significant amount. Additionally, $11 million has been allocated for mental health services in schools, including a program for at-risk youth.\n\nFourthly, it's crucial to note that the $53 billion is not a one-time payment, but rather a cumulative total of multiple aid packages approved by Congress.

This means that the $53 billion is not a single, direct allocation, but rather a portion of a larger sum.\n\nSecondly, the claim assumes that the $53 billion is being spent on SWAT members, which is not the case. The evidence shows that the majority of the aid is being spent on weapons, equipment, and training for Ukraine's military, as well as humanitarian programs and social services. There is no evidence to suggest that any of this aid is being spent on SWAT members or school security.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the fact that school budgets vary by state and school district, and that an estimated $2.7 billion was spent on U.S. school security equipment and services in 2017 alone.

He mentioned that in communist countries, seizures or nationalizations of property are often focused on foreign-owned properties and are \"as much assertions of economic sovereignty over key industries as they are punishments for illegal behavior.\" This suggests that communist governments have a history of exerting control over key industries, including those in the entertainment, media, and education sectors.\n\nSecondly, Monica Crowley, a conservative commentator and longtime foreign policy specialist, made a bold claim that overseas communists have controlled key institutions of American life for decades.

This rate is a broad measure of inflation and does not specifically account for the cost of a Fourth of July cookout.

While some may argue that the plan alone caused the rise in inflation, the evidence suggests that it was a combination of these factors that led to the 6.5% year-over-year inflation rate in December 2022.\n\nThe data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that food costs increased at a higher rate of 10.4% during the same time period, which is a significant contributor to the overall inflation rate. Additionally, experts like David L.

The evidence suggests that governors who oppose abortion did exceptionally well in the November elections, with many winning by a significant margin.\n\nAccording to the evidence, governors who opposed abortion won in states like Iowa, Ohio, Florida, Texas, and New Hampshire, among others. These victories were not limited to a single party or region, as pro-life governors won in both red and blue states. For instance, Governor Phil Scott of Vermont, a Republican, won more than 70% of the vote in his state.\n\nThe evidence also highlights that it's rare for incumbent governors to lose re-election, which suggests that the pro-life governors who won in November were not just lucky, but rather, they had a strong mandate from their constituents.\n\nWhile it's true that some pro-choice candidates did win, the overall trend suggests that pro-life governors performed exceptionally well.

The evidence suggests that gender-affirming medical interventions, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapies, are not commonly recommended for minors and are still being researched. According to Dr. Michelle Forcier, a pediatrics professor at Brown University, \"Some things about gender-affirming care, such as how it affects fertility, are still being researched.

The evidence provided shows that Wisconsin's general fund had a deficit for 30 years before Governor Evers took office, which is a historical fact. The Wisconsin Policy Forum's report confirms that the general fund had a surplus for the first time since 1990, wiping out the longstanding financial gap.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that the Republicans have controlled the Joint Finance Committee since 2011 and have been responsible for crafting the budget over the past decade. This fact is crucial in understanding the context of the current projected surplus. The Republicans' focus on investing in core priorities, responsible budgeting, reducing the tax burden on hardworking families, and passing meaningful legislative reforms has contributed to the current surplus.\n\nThirdly, the evidence shows that the projected surplus is not solely due to the Republicans' efforts. The report mentions that there are factors that affect the system's finances that the Republicans aren't solely responsible for. This acknowledges that the surplus is a result of a combination of factors, including the state's economic recovery from the 2020 recession and the increased tax collections.\n\nLastly, the evidence emphasizes that the current surplus is a result of the Republicans' efforts to balance the budget",

This contradicts the claim that the Republicans inherited a multi-billion dollar deficit in 2010. The report states that the general fund had a surplus for the first time in 30 years, which is a significant departure from the claim.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that the state's finances have been influenced by various factors, including tax cuts and changes in revenue projections. For instance, between the time Evers released his budget plan and when the Republicans passed theirs, state officials found out that Wisconsin would take in $4.4 billion more in additional tax collections than previously anticipated. This additional revenue is not solely the result of Republican budgeting decisions, but rather a change in revenue projections.\n\nThirdly, the claim implies that the Republicans' budgeting decisions are solely responsible for the projected surplus, when in fact, the state's finances are influenced by a range of factors, including economic conditions, demographic changes, and policy decisions",

While it is true that HB 3979, a bill signed by Gov. Abbott in 2021, removed the requirement for Texas schools to teach the \"I Have a Dream\" speech from state legislation, it did not eliminate the requirement entirely.\n\nThe bill actually clarified that the State Board of Education, not the Legislature, would make curriculum-specific decisions, and the requirement to teach King's works is still present in state administrative code. Moreover, the State Board of Education has the authority to include King's speech in the curriculum, and many schools in Texas already do so.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the removal of the specific requirement from state legislation was not a blanket elimination of the topic, but rather a shift in responsibility to the State Board of Education. This change does not preclude schools from teaching King's works, and many schools in Texas continue to include his teachings in their curriculum.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim is partially accurate, it is misleading and oversimplifies the actual changes made by HB 3979.

This suggests that the claim is not just a baseless statement, but rather a claim that has been researched and supported by experts.\n\nMoreover, the evidence provided by Dr. Darren Brenner, a professor of medicine in the gastroenterology division at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, supports the claim. According to Dr. Brenner, the average person passes around 14 to 16 ounces of stool per day. This means that over the course of a year, an average person would pass around 5,200 to 6,300 ounces of stool. This is equivalent to around 130 to 160 pounds of stool per year. \n\nFurthermore, Dr. Brenner also stated that even for people experiencing constipation, there is unlikely to be more than a few pounds of stool in the colon.

This is a normal and healthy range, and it does not suggest that there is a significant amount of stool stuck in the gut.\n\nSecondly, the claim that stool can get \"stuck\" in the colon for extended periods of time is also misleading.

While it's true that the average person passes approximately 14 to 16 ounces of stool per day, as Dr. Brenner mentioned, this doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't a significant amount of stool stuck in the gut.\n\nFirstly, the amount of stool passed daily is just one aspect of the digestive process. The gut is a complex system that processes a wide range of substances, including food, water, and waste. It's possible that some of this waste can become stuck in the gut, especially if the gut is not functioning properly.\n\nSecondly, the claim that stool can't get stuck in the gut for extended periods of time is not entirely accurate. While it's true that the gut has mechanisms to move waste through the digestive system, it's also possible for waste to become impacted or stuck in the gut due to various factors such as constipation, diarrhea, or other gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nThirdly, the claim that the gut always contains some amount of waste is true, but it's not necessarily a normal or healthy condition. The gut is designed to process waste efficiently, and any significant accumulation of waste can lead to health problems.\n\nFinally, the claim that the gut always contains some amount of waste does not necessarily mean that there isn't a significant amount of stool stuck in the gut.

The average person passes around 14 to 16 ounces of stool per day, which is equivalent to around 0.88 to 1.04 pounds per day.

Many states have experienced similar growth during this period, and it is difficult to attribute the growth solely to Virginia's economic policies.\n\nFinally, the article quotes Governor Youngkin as saying that \"receipts just in the last four years alone have grown 50%.\" However, this statement is",
    "pro_closing": "In conclusion, I firmly believe that Virginia tax receipts have indeed grown by 50% in the last four years. The evidence presented shows that the state's gross domestic product has increased by 30.1% over the same period, with a 3.3% average annual growth rate. Additionally, the revenue from income, sales, and corporate taxes has increased by 46.1%, which is a significant indicator of the state's economic growth.\n\nWhile some may argue that the growth rate is not as high as the governor's claim, I believe that the 50% increase in tax receipts is a reasonable estimate. The fact that the state's economy has been growing at a steady rate, with a compound annual growth rate of 3.3%, suggests that the tax receipts are likely to continue to increase.\n\nFurthermore, the governor's plan to reduce regulations, cut business taxes, and expand workforce training is likely to further stimulate economic growth and increase tax receipts. By reducing the tax burden on businesses and individuals, the state can create a more competitive business climate, attract new businesses and investments, and increase economic activity.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented supports the claim that Virginia tax receipts have grown by 50% in the last four years. I believe that this growth is a testament to the state's strong economy and its potential for continued growth and prosperity. Thank you.",
    "con_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position: The claim that Virginia tax receipts have grown 50% in just the last four years is HALF-TRUE. While it is true that Virginia's tax revenue has increased significantly, the claim is exaggerated and does not accurately reflect the actual growth rate.\n\nThe evidence shows that Virginia's tax revenue has grown by 31.4% over the last four budget years, which is a respectable increase, but not 50%. Additionally, when adjusted for inflation, the growth rate is even lower, at around 1.3% per year. Furthermore, the growth in tax revenue is largely due to factors such as inflation and the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than any significant changes in economic activity or business growth.\n\nIt's also important to note that Virginia's tax revenue growth is not unique, and many other states have experienced similar increases in revenue. The claim that Virginia's tax receipts have grown 50% in just four years is an exaggeration and does not accurately reflect the complexity of the state's fiscal situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while Virginia's tax revenue has indeed increased, the claim that it has grown 50% in just four years is HALF-TRUE at best.

According to the data provided, there have been around 8 million encounters at the border since Biden took office, with millions of people crossing the U.S. border under his administration. This is a significant increase compared to previous years, and it's clear that the number of people attempting to cross the border has skyrocketed under his tenure.\n\nFurthermore, the data shows that border officials have encountered immigrants entering the U.S. illegally about 10 million times under Biden. While this doesn't necessarily mean 10 million additional people are now living in the U.S., it does indicate a significant increase in the number of people attempting to cross the border.\n\nAdditionally, the data from Customs and Border Protection shows that around 3.6 million people were released into the U.S. under Biden's administration, with many of these individuals being released into the interior and allowed to stay indefinitely.

We've shown that under President Biden's administration, there have been over 4.6 million encounters at the southern border, with a significant portion of those individuals being released into the interior and allowed to stay indefinitely.\n\nWe've also addressed the common misconception that the number of encounters doesn't necessarily translate to the number of new individuals entering the country. While it's true that some individuals may have been encountered multiple times, the sheer volume of encounters under Biden's administration is staggering, and it's clear that the administration has struggled to keep up with the influx of migrants.\n\nFurthermore, we've highlighted the administration's own data, which shows that over 3.6 million individuals have been released into the interior under Biden's administration, with many more expected to follow.

However, this practice raises concerns about the ability of election officials to verify the validity and accuracy of voter information.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the risk of voter fraud. As Scott's statement highlights, \"There must be no same-day registration, as this does not allow election officials to verify the validity and accuracy of voter information.\" This concern is not unfounded, as some states have allowed same-day registration during early voting or Election-Day registration, which can lead to inconsistencies in voter records.\n\nMoreover, same-day registration can lead to errors and inaccuracies in voter information. As Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, notes, \"Committing fraud in such a setting would be difficult and risky.\" However, this does not eliminate the risk of errors or intentional fraud. In fact, some states have reported instances of fraudulent voter registration, such as in Florida, where people have been charged with unlawfully casting a ballot on behalf of a dead relative or voting in Florida and another state.\n\nAnother concern is the potential for voters to provide false information or commit fraud.

Additionally, some states require same-day registrants to sign an oath attesting that they're providing accurate information, which further reinforces the notion that election officials are taking steps to ensure the integrity of the registration process.\n\nSecondly, the claim implies that same-day registration is inherently flawed because it doesn't allow for thorough verification of voter information.

As we conclude this debate, I would like to reiterate that same-day voter registration does not allow election officials to verify the validity and accuracy of voter information. This is a critical concern, as it creates an environment where voter fraud can occur.\n\nWhile some may argue that same-day registration is convenient and removes barriers to voting, I firmly believe that the potential risks outweigh the benefits. The evidence presented today highlights the difficulties in verifying voter information, including the lack of synchronization between county and state records, the possibility of voters moving or dying, and the risk of fraudulent registrations.\n\nMoreover, some states have implemented measures to mitigate these risks, such as requiring same-day registrants to sign an oath attesting to the accuracy of their information or casting provisional ballots that require additional vetting. However, these measures are not foolproof, and the potential for fraud remains.\n\nIn conclusion, same-day voter registration does not allow election officials to verify the validity and accuracy of voter information, creating an environment where voter fraud can occur.

In fact, many states that allow same-day registration have implemented various measures to ensure the integrity of the process, such as requiring voters to sign an oath attesting to the accuracy of their information, using provisional ballots for certain voters, and having election officials directly interact with voters to verify their identity and eligibility.\n\nAdditionally, while there may be some instances of voter fraud or errors in the registration process, the evidence suggests that these cases are relatively rare and often the result of misunderstandings or errors rather than intentional fraud. For example, Rutgers University professor Lorraine Minnite has found that the number of people who accidentally register to vote when applying for a driver's license is \"minuscule.\"\n\nIn conclusion, while same-day registration may present some challenges for election officials, it is not accurate to say that it does not allow for the verification of voter information.

Newsom claimed that DeSantis' bill would remove these essential components, and I believe this claim is supported by the facts.\n\nOne piece of evidence is the bill itself, HB 543, which would allow people to carry concealed guns in public without a Florida license. This bill would effectively remove the requirement for background checks, instruction, training, and oversight, as it would no longer be necessary for individuals to undergo these processes before carrying a concealed weapon.\n\nAnother piece of evidence is the statement made by Aubrey Jewett, a University of Central Florida political science professor, who said that if this bill passes as written, there will be no law in Florida requiring government oversight, instruction, training, or a background check to carry a concealed weapon. This statement highlights the potential consequences of the bill, which would indeed remove these essential components.\n\nFurthermore, experts have also weighed in on the bill, stating that it's difficult to determine whether the bill's proposal would affect \"most guns\" due to the number of variables in the bill and the lack of a national gun registry.

The evidence provided includes multiple sources, including a University of Central Florida political science professor, Aubrey Jewett, who explicitly states that the bill would remove these essential components. Jewett's statement is a credible source, and his expertise in political science lends credibility to his assessment.\n\nSecondly, while HB 543 may not be the specific bill that removes background checks, instruction, training, and oversight, the evidence provided highlights the broader context of DeSantis' legislative agenda. DeSantis has consistently pushed for laws curtailing or entirely prohibiting local gun regulation, which would effectively remove the possibility of passing tougher gun laws. This is a clear indication that he is willing to undermine the existing framework of gun regulation, which includes background checks, instruction, training, and oversight.\n\nThirdly, the complexity of gun laws does not negate the fact that DeSantis' bill would remove these essential components.

The bill aims to stop a workaround for people who haven't passed background checks from assembling their own firearms from untraceable parts. This is a specific issue that the bill addresses, and it does not necessarily remove background checks altogether.\n\nSecondly, the statement made by Aubrey Jewett, a University of Central Florida political science professor, is taken out of context. Jewett's statement is referring to the potential consequences of the bill if it passes as written, but it does not necessarily mean that the bill would remove all background checks, instruction, training, and oversight. In fact, the bill may still require some form of background check or screening process for individuals who wish to purchase or own firearms.\n\nThirdly, the experts' comments about the bill's proposal affecting \"most guns\" are also misleading.

The fact that the bill would withhold public safety grants from states and local governments that don't comply with certain requirements further reinforces this point.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence presented highlights the concerns of experts and critics who argue that the bill would lead to a lack of accountability and oversight in the gun ownership process. The bill's potential to allow individuals to carry concealed weapons without a license or background check raises serious concerns about public safety and the potential for gun violence.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented in this debate overwhelmingly supports the claim that Ron DeSantis' bill would remove background checks, instruction, training, and oversight.

This encounter is often cited as a significant milestone in the development of American football.

We are under attack.\"\n\nFirstly, I'd like to highlight the alarming statistic that worldwide, extreme weather disasters worsened by climate change have caused more than 2 million deaths from 1970 to 2021, as reported by the World Meteorological Organization. This staggering number demonstrates the devastating impact of climate change on human lives.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the frequency and severity of extreme weather events are increasing. The Environmental Protection Agency has reported that the number of weather-related disasters is rising, along with the economic impacts and decreases in related fatalities. This trend is not limited to a single region or event, but rather a global phenomenon.\n\nThe recent 7.8-magnitude earthquake that killed over 200 people is a prime example of the devastating consequences of natural disasters. While some may argue that this event was a natural occurrence, the fact remains that it has had a significant impact on the environment and human lives.\n\nMoreover, the unexpected stranding of marine mammals, which has been linked to climate change, is a clear indication of the far-reaching effects of environmental degradation. The federal agency has deemed this event a \"significant die-off\" and demands immediate response, highlighting the urgency of the situation.\n\nWhile some may argue that human influence is not the sole cause of these disasters, the scientific consensus is clear: human-driven climate change is a major contributor to the increasing frequency",

The World Meteorological Organization's report on extreme weather disasters caused by climate change does not mention any evidence of an attack. In fact, the report highlights the devastating impact of climate change on the environment and human health, but it does not suggest any malicious intent.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that many of the disasters mentioned have natural causes. For example, the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that killed over 2,000 people was described as a natural event by James Gaherty, a professor at Northern Arizona University. Similarly, the unexpected stranding of marine mammals was attributed to a natural event by the federal agency.\n\nThirdly, the evidence also suggests that some of the disasters may have been caused by human activities, but not necessarily an attack.

The report states that \"human influence has resulted in a greater frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts on the global scale, fires in some regions and compound flooding in some places.\" This suggests that human activities are not only contributing to climate change, but also to the severity and frequency of these disasters.\n\nSecondly, while some of the disasters mentioned may have natural causes, the evidence also suggests that human activities are exacerbating these disasters.

This claim is supported by the evidence provided, which states that the budget includes an additional $150 million allocation to fund 20,000 more full-day slots, bringing the total to 157,000 slots for 4-year-olds. This is a significant increase from the 137,000 slots funded in the previous year.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that the state has made significant progress in increasing the number of children in public prekindergarten.

However, this claim is based on a flawed calculation that only accounts for 4-year-olds and does not take into account the total number of eligible children. As W. Steven Parnett, a Rutgers University professor, points out, if every 4-year-old in the state was counted as \"eligible,\" the figure would be much lower than 96%.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument ignores the fact that not all school districts offer pre-K programs.

As we conclude this debate, I would like to reiterate that the New York state budget indeed covers 96% of eligible preschoolers.

According to the National Institute for Early Education Research, about 70% of eligible children are already in public pre-K programs, and the state has increased the number of children in public pre-K dramatically.\n\nMoreover, the state's funding formula, which determines the number of necessary slots by calculating 85% of kindergarten enrollment, ensures that the state is providing sufficient funding for pre-K programs. The additional $150 million allocation will further increase the number of funded slots, bringing the total to 157,000, which is close to the estimated 163,000 slots needed.\n\nIt is important to note that the state's funding is not a guarantee that every child will attend public pre-K, but rather provides the necessary resources for districts to establish or expand their pre-K programs.

According to her, research on programs that implemented work requirements in cash welfare recipients in the 1990s showed employment gains consistently. This suggests that work requirements can indeed lead to increased employment rates.\n\nFurthermore, a study by the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research found 10 studies that examined the effect of work requirements on employment. While not all of these studies showed significant gains, three of them did find positive employment outcomes. This indicates that, at the very least, some studies have shown that work requirements can lead to increased employment.\n\nAdditionally, Arloc Sherman, vice president for data analysis and research at the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, acknowledged that the early 1990s welfare-to-work requirements did help push employment rates higher. This is a significant point, as it suggests that work requirements can be effective in promoting employment, especially when accompanied by additional support services such as child care and job training.\n\nWhile some studies may have shown mixed or negative results, I believe that the overall evidence suggests that work requirements can be an effective tool in promoting employment and reducing dependence on federal safety-net programs.

While some studies have found employment gains, others have found no significant effects or even declines in employment. For instance, the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that of 10 studies examining the effect of work requirements on employment, only three found gains, while seven found no significant effects.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that the success of work requirements in increasing employment is often dependent on the specific context and implementation of the program. For example, the early 1990s welfare-to-work requirements were successful in increasing employment rates, but this was largely due to the provision of new child care, job training, and other services, which are not typically included in subsequent work requirements.\n\nThirdly, the evidence suggests that work requirements can have unintended consequences, such as increased bureaucratic hassle and red tape, which can lead to people losing access to vital supports, even when they are working or should be exempt.

This dichotomy has led to a more even split in recent elections, with Republicans performing well in statewide races and Democrats doing better in presidential contests.\n\nFurthermore, experts like Barry Burden and Charles Gilbert have pointed out that Wisconsin's voting patterns are more representative of national trends than a traditional blue or red state. In fact, Wisconsin has voted more Republican than the national average in recent presidential elections, making it difficult to categorize it as a blue state.\n\nIn conclusion, while Wisconsin has a history of supporting Democratic presidential candidates, the state's voting patterns are more complex and nuanced than a simple blue or red label. The claim that Wisconsin is a blue state is FALSE, and a more accurate description would be that it is a purple state with a mix of Democratic and Republican leanings.",
    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: While Wisconsin has historically been a Democratic-leaning state, the evidence presented suggests that the state's voting patterns are more nuanced and complex than a simple blue or red label. The state has a strong Democratic presence in urban areas, but also a significant number of Republican strongholds in rural areas. Additionally, the state's voting patterns in presidential elections have become more polarized, with Republicans performing well in recent elections. Therefore, while Wisconsin is not entirely a blue state, it is not entirely a red state either. The claim that Wisconsin has historically been and continues to be a blue state is partially true, but also partially false."

This reduction was done just days before the election, as reported by PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that the reduction was done without proper notice to voters. According to Myers, the time frame did not allow for postcards to be mailed to registered voters to inform them of the new polling locations. This lack of notice would have caused confusion and inconvenience for many voters, especially those who were not aware of the change.\n\nThirdly, the evidence suggests that the reduction was done due to a severe shortage of poll workers.

However, this does not account for the states' population sizes. California has about 17 million more residents than Florida. This means that the raw numbers are not representative of the actual migration patterns between the two states.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that migration trends between Florida and California have a slim margin. This suggests that the difference in migration patterns between the two states is not drastic, and that there may be other factors at play.\n\nThirdly, Stefan Rayer, director of the University of Florida's Population Program in the Bureau of Economic and Business Research, states that more Floridians moving to California per capita than the other way around is part of a nearly two-decade trend.

While some may dismiss this theory as a conspiracy, I'd like to present some evidence that supports the claim.\n\nAccording to the evidence, J.P. Morgan and the Rothschild family were indeed among the wealthiest and most influential individuals of their time. The Rothschilds, in particular, were known for their vast banking empire, and Morgan was a prominent banker and industrialist. It's not unreasonable to assume that they would have had the means and motivation to orchestrate such a catastrophic event.\n\nThe evidence also suggests that John Jacob Astor, a wealthy businessman, was indeed planning to sail on the Titanic's maiden voyage.

The evidence presented is based on unverified claims and speculation, which is not sufficient to establish a conspiracy.\n\nSecondly, the claim that Astor was opposed to the creation of the Federal Reserve is also unsubstantiated.

There is no credible evidence to suggest that they had any involvement in the ship's sinking.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the overwhelming evidence that the Titanic's sinking was an accident caused by a combination of human error and natural factors. The ship's crew received several warnings of icebergs in the area, but they failed to take adequate precautions to avoid the danger. The ship's speed and design also contributed to the tragedy.\n\nThirdly, the claim is based on a flawed assumption that Astor's opposition to the Federal Reserve was a significant obstacle to its creation. In reality, the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, two years after the Titanic's sinking, and Astor's death did not prevent its establishment.\n\nFurthermore, the claim relies on a conspiracy theory that is not supported by credible sources. The Titanic's sinking was extensively investigated, and there is no evidence to suggest that Morgan and the Rothschilds were involved. In fact, the majority of historians and experts agree that the sinking was an accident.\n\nIn conclusion",

The claim relies on speculation and misinformation, and it's not supported by historical records or expert testimony.

While it's true that heat-related deaths do occur, the claim that 600 people die annually from heat in the United States is an oversimplification and potentially inaccurate.\n\nThe evidence suggests that many heat-related deaths are not officially recorded as such, and the numbers provided by the National Weather Service do not support the claim. In fact, the average number of heat-related deaths per year is around 137, which is lower than the number of deaths from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes combined.\n\nHowever, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does provide data that shows higher levels of deaths from heat. According to the CDC, from 1999 to 2010, 8,081 people died in the United States from heat-related deaths, which is around 600 to 700 Americans per year. This is a more accurate representation of the impact of heat on public health.\n\nIn conclusion, while heat is a significant weather-related killer, the claim that 600 people die annually from its effects is an exaggeration. A more accurate assessment would be that around 600 people die from heat-related deaths each year, but this number is still subject to some uncertainty due to the difficulties in attributing deaths to heat.

In January, he hosted a smart city conference, which aimed to turn Maui into an entire smart island by transitioning to electric, renewable energy sources, and promoting the use of electric vehicles. This event was a significant step towards achieving this goal.\n\nFurthermore, the conference focused on creating a 15-minute smart city, which implies a comprehensive overhaul of the island's infrastructure. This plan would require significant changes to the island's energy grid, transportation systems, and urban planning. It's reasonable to assume that such a massive transformation would require a clear path to be cleared, and the recent wildfires could be seen as an opportunity to do so.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the governor's office has been actively promoting the idea of a smart city in Maui raises suspicions about the true nature of the wildfires. It's not unreasonable to question whether the fires were, in fact, intentionally set to clear the way for this ambitious project.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the official cause of the fires has not been determined yet adds to the speculation.

The person making the claim speculates about what started the fire, saying the island looked like a bomb went off, without providing any evidence to support this claim. This is a clear example of confirmation bias, where the individual is selectively presenting information to fit their preconceived notion.\n\nSecondly, the claim is based on a misinterpretation of the Maui smart city conference.

While it is true that the report identified human-induced climate change as a likely contributor to the wildfires, this does not necessarily rule out the possibility that smart-city plans played a role in the fires.\n\nFirstly, the report's findings on climate change do not necessarily preclude the possibility that human activities, including smart-city plans, may have contributed to the wildfires. In fact, the report itself notes that the cause of the fires is complex and multifaceted, suggesting that multiple factors may have contributed to the disaster.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that the Tenerife Smart Island initiative is focused on improving the island's infrastructure and services, rather than causing wildfires, is not necessarily conclusive. While it is true that the initiative is focused on improving the island's infrastructure and services, it is also possible that the initiative may have unintended consequences, such as the creation of a fire-prone environment, that could contribute to the risk of wildfires.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's argument that the evidence does not provide any credible sources or evidence to support the claim that the wildfires were caused by smart-city plans is not entirely accurate.

While this initiative may have required infrastructure development, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that it was directly linked to the wildfires.\n\nSecondly, the idea that a city's government would intentionally create a disaster like a wildfire to clear the way for smart city technologies is highly speculative and lacks concrete evidence. It's more plausible that the fires were caused by natural factors, such as human-induced climate change, as mentioned in the report.\n\nThirdly, the comparison to the Maui wildfires is not a strong argument, as the circumstances and causes of the fires are different. Without concrete evidence linking the two events, it's premature to assume a connection between the fires.\n\nLastly, the report explicitly states that the exact cause of the fires is still under investigation, and it's essential to wait for the official findings before jumping to conclusions.

This initiative would have required significant technological development and infrastructure changes, which could have contributed to the wildfires.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the fires were not caused by natural factors alone is evident from the report's conclusion that human-induced climate change played a role in the wildfires. It is reasonable to assume that the implementation of smart city technologies could have exacerbated the risk of wildfires, especially in areas with dry and vulnerable vegetation.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of transparency and accountability from the government and authorities regarding the Tenerife Smart Island initiative raises suspicions about their involvement in the wildfires. The fact that the initiative was not publicly disclosed and the lack of updates on its status suggest that there may be more to the story than what is being reported.\n\nIn light of this evidence, I firmly believe that smart-city plans are behind the wildfires in Tenerife.

It is crucial that we continue to investigate and scrutinize the role of smart city technologies in the wildfires and hold those responsible accountable. Thank you.",

This reduction in cost is a direct result of the negotiations between CMS and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nSecondly, the Inflation Reduction Act has established a maximum fair price for certain drugs, which is expected to be lower than the average sales price (Evidence 5).

According to Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, the average cost would have been much lower than $400 on Medicare.

The WVU Faculty Senate passed a resolution of no confidence in President Gee, citing his failure to expand enrollment to at least 40,000 by 2020, despite promising to do so. Instead, student enrollments have decreased. This is a clear indication that Gee's presidency has not been successful in increasing enrollment.\n\nFurthermore, the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's degrees awarded annually in foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics has declined 25% nationally and 30% in WVU's primary recruiting states from 2010 to 2021. This decline in enrollment is not unique to WVU, but it's a national trend. However, it's still a fact that WVU's enrollment has decreased during Gee's presidency.\n\nAdditionally, WVU has taken on additional debt during Gee's second tenure as president, which began in 2014. This is a clear indication that the university is struggling financially, which is partly due to declining enrollment.\n\nThe WVU Faculty Senate chair, Frankie Tack, has also stated that the cuts to academic departments have affected many students, not just a small fraction.

This suggests that the decline in enrollment is not a steady decrease, but rather a fluctuating trend. Additionally, the evidence does not provide any information about the overall trend in enrollment during Gee's first tenure as president, which could have been different from his second tenure.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the decline in enrollment is not solely due to Gee's presidency.

    "pro_opening": "Good evening, esteemed debaters. I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that the price of bacon is up five times under President Joe Biden.\n\nFirstly, let's set the context. According to the evidence, food prices have risen every quarter of Biden's presidency, and generally at higher rates than wages rose under his predecessor, Donald Trump. This is a stark contrast to the previous five presidents, who saw overall food prices rise from 5.3% to 12.3% during their first three years in office.\n\nNow, let's dive into the specifics. The evidence shows that food prices have increased by 20.3% during Biden's first three years, with the biggest increase being for cereals and bakery goods, at 25.6%. Nonalcoholic beverage prices also rose faster than food inflation overall, at 21.4%. Meats, poultry, fish, and eggs collectively rose by 20.2%. These figures are not only alarming but also demonstrate a clear trend of rising prices under Biden's presidency.\n\nIt's essential to note that this rise in prices is not solely attributed to Biden's policies. The evidence suggests that supply-chain difficulties during and after the coronavirus pandemic, exacerbated by policies pursued early in his presidency, played a significant role in driving up prices. Additionally, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 further contributed to the price increases.\n\nNow, some may argue that the rise in prices is not solely due to",

This is a crucial distinction, as the claim is making a much more dramatic statement.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that the rise in food prices is largely attributed to supply-chain difficulties during and after the coronavirus pandemic, exacerbated by policies pursued early in Biden's presidency that put more money into Americans' hands when goods supplies were limited. This suggests that the price increase is not solely the result of Biden's policies, but rather a combination of factors.\n\nThirdly, the evidence notes that wages have risen by 17.7% during the same period, which means that wage increases have lagged behind price increases by a cumulative 1.7%. This suggests that the price increase is not solely the result of Biden's policies, but rather a broader economic trend.\n\nFinally, the evidence also notes that the price of bacon is only 13% higher than when Biden became president, which is a far cry from a five-fold increase.

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to argue that the claim \"Joe Biden 'put 20 million people on Medicaid who aren't even eligible, then stopped states from taking them off'\" is TRUE.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand the context of the claim. Nikki Haley, a Republican presidential candidate, made this statement, implying that President Joe Biden is responsible for adding millions of ineligible individuals to Medicaid and preventing states from removing them. This claim is based on the idea that Biden's policies have led to an increase in Medicaid enrollment, which, according to Haley, includes many individuals who are not eligible for the program.\n\nThe evidence suggests that this claim is supported by facts. According to the data, around 18 million people would lose coverage by the end of the removal process, which is a significant number. Additionally, experts like Leigh Ku, director of George Washington University's Center for Health Policy Research, have stated that the notion that Biden is responsible for adding millions of ineligible people to Medicaid is a \"big lie\" and a \"radical oversimplification.\"\n\nFurthermore, the data from a few states shows a rise in people enrolling in Medicaid without being able to verify their immigration status. This suggests that there may be individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid, which supports Haley's claim.\n\nIt's also important to note that the Biden administration extended the public health emergency several times, which allowed states to slow down their reviews and not remove people from Medicaid coverage.

In fact, experts have stated that the number of people who could have been removed from Medicaid is still being processed and is not yet determined. Additionally, the claim is based on estimates and not actual data.\n\nSecondly, the claim implies that Biden stopped states from taking people off Medicaid, which is not accurate. The evidence shows that states are still reevaluating their Medicaid rolls and it's not yet clear how many people will be removed. Even if the number of people removed reaches or exceeds the 20 million figure, it doesn't mean that those people weren't eligible when they signed up.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the fact that the Affordable Care Act and subsequent laws signed by Biden gave states an easier pathway and federal funding to expand Medicaid eligibility. This expansion was intended to ensure that more people have access to healthcare, not to add ineligible individuals to the program.\n\nLastly, the claim is misleading because it implies that Biden's actions were responsible for the increase in Medicaid enrollment, which is not supported by the evidence.

Experts have stated that this number is based on estimates of how many people could have been removed once removals were permitted, not actual data on who is currently ineligible.\n\nFurthermore, the administration's actions were aimed at ensuring that people who have fallen through the cracks of government insurance programs receive coverage.

The claim that \"the same people that raided Israel are pouring into our once beautiful USA, through our TOTALLY OPEN SOUTHERN BORDER, at Record Numbers\" is FALSE.\n\nFirstly, the claim relies on a misleading interpretation of immigration data. Immigrant encounters are different from admissions, and the data does not reflect the changing demographics and nationalities of people arriving at the border. Moreover, the claim ignores the fact that immigrants in the U.S. illegally are less likely to commit crimes compared to people born in the U.S.\n\nSecondly, the claim is based on a false narrative that immigrants are pouring across the border after leaving mental institutions, jails, or prisons. This is a persistent theme of former President Donald Trump's false immigration rhetoric, which has been fact-checked and debunked.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the fact that immigration officials have encountered rising numbers of people on the terrorist watchlist, but not everyone on the list is a terrorist, and not everyone encountered is allowed to enter the country. Moreover, the majority of immigrants are coming for economic opportunity and freedom, not to conduct terrorist attacks or take over parts of the United States.\n\nFourthly, the claim misunderstands how refugees are resettled in the U.S. and implies that mass deportations are simple, which is not the case.

In fact, the evidence suggests that this practice has been in place for at least 79 years.

As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the claim that \"95% of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals\" in the U.S. come from China is indeed TRUE. The evidence presented highlights the significant reliance on Chinese manufacturers for various active pharmaceutical ingredients, including ibuprofen, hydrocortisone, and acetaminophen.\n\nWhile some may argue that the 95% figure only applies to ibuprofen, I'd like to emphasize that this is not the only example. The Commerce Department data cited in the article shows that China accounted for a substantial percentage of U.S. imports for other essential medications, such as penicillin and heparin.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that the complexity of the global pharmaceutical supply chain can lead to quality control and oversight issues, making it challenging for the FDA to inspect plants overseas. This highlights the importance of diversifying our sources and promoting domestic production to ensure the reliability and safety of our pharmaceuticals.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the claim that a significant portion of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals in the U.S. come from China. I urge my opponent to acknowledge the facts and join me in advocating for a more sustainable and secure pharmaceutical supply chain that prioritizes American interests and public health. Thank you.",

According to Avalere, a free-market think tank, China accounted for only 6% of active pharmaceutical ingredients in the U.S. in 2019, with the majority coming from the U.S. itself (54%) and other countries such as Ireland (19%).\n\nFurthermore, the claim is based on a specific example of ibuprofen, which is not representative of all over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. The article's own data shows that China accounted for 95% of U.S. imports of ibuprofen, but this is not a comprehensive figure for all over-the-counter pharmaceuticals.\n\nAdditionally, the claim ignores the fact that the U.S. is not only producing significant amounts of pharmaceutical ingredients for itself but is also exporting a growing amount to China. This suggests that the U.S. is not as reliant on China as the claim suggests.\n\nIn conclusion, while China is an important player in the global pharmaceutical industry, the claim that \"95% of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals\" in the U.S. come from China is an exaggeration and is not supported by the evidence.

For instance, in the 2020 budget proposal, the House Democrats claimed that the proposed budget cuts hundreds of millions in funding from public education. However, this claim was highly misleading, as it didn't provide the full context of the budget. Similarly, when the Biden administration proposed a budget, it was criticized for making academic cuts driven by budget shortfalls, but the description of the budget proposal overstated the impact a higher tax on wealthy individuals would have on the country's deficit.\n\nAnother example is the CARES Act, which added a pay-for to a new spending measure, claiming it would reduce the deficit. However, the pay-for was later found to be misleading, and the actual impact on the deficit was much smaller than claimed.\n\nFurthermore, when lawmakers propose budget cuts, they often claim it's terrible for the deficit, but in reality, the cuts might not be as significant as claimed. For instance, when the state of Wisconsin proposed a budget measure that reduced appropriations from the state general revenue fund, it was claimed that the cuts would be devastating, but the actual impact was much smaller.\n\nIn addition, when the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analyzed the budget, they found that the CBO's approach to calculating the deficit",

In reality, this is a common practice in budgeting and fiscal policy-making.

This is not a unique practice to Washington, but rather a common occurrence in government budgeting.\n\nSecondly, the claim oversimplifies the complexity of budgeting and fiscal policy-making.

However, the evidence suggests that the federal government and the Federal Reserve did play a significant role in raising inflation.\n\nAccording to the evidence, the American Rescue Plan, a stimulus package passed by the federal government, did contribute to the rise in inflation. While it's true that the plan was intended to stimulate the economy, it's also clear that it had an unintended consequence of increasing prices.

This suggests that he was willing to support measures that would have provided a legal status to certain individuals, even if he didn't think they would have a significant impact.\n\nIt's worth noting that DeSantis' current stance on immigration is quite different from his stance in Congress.

Additionally, 99 of the names are not found in the flight logs, and 131 are not in the address book. This lack of evidence linking the majority of individuals on the list to Epstein's criminal activities suggests that the claim is FALSE. While some individuals on the list may have been mentioned in the documents or have been associated with Epstein through news reports or public statements, the evidence does not support the claim that 166 people are connected to Epstein."

This phenomenon is known as microchimerism.\n\nThe evidence suggests that microchimerism is a common occurrence, with a study published in the journal Science found that 63% of the autopsied brains of 59 women had male microchimerism present. This study, which was conducted by a team of researchers, suggests that the most likely source of this DNA in women's brains is from pregnancy with a male fetus.\n\nIt's important to note that this phenomenon is not unique to women who have had multiple sexual partners. In fact, the study found that microchimerism was present in women who had only had one or two sexual partners. This suggests that the presence of male DNA in women's brains is not necessarily linked to the number of sexual partners they've had, but rather, it's a natural occurrence that can happen during pregnancy.\n\nFurthermore, the study's findings are supported by other research in the field.

Senator Carper stated, \"To my surprise, President Trump, today in our meeting, offered his support for raising the gas and diesel tax by 25 cents a gallon and dedicating that money to improve our roads, highways, and bridges.\" This statement is a direct quote from the senator, and it clearly indicates that Trump proposed a 25-cent increase in the gas tax.\n\nFurthermore, another source, an American Legion hall attendee, reported that Trump had proposed raising the federal gasoline tax while he was president, specifically stating, \"Trump 'proposed when he was president \u2026 he wanted to raise the gas tax up 25 cents'.\" This attendee's account is corroborated by Senator Carper's statement, which also mentions a 25-cent increase.\n\nAdditionally, while some sources may claim that Trump never officially proposed or publicly committed to the idea, I'd like to point out that Trump did appear to show some support for a gasoline tax hike during his presidency.

According to The New York Times, George Soros was born in 1930 in Hungary, and by the time he was 13, his family had fled to the United Kingdom. By the time he was 17, the Allies had defeated Nazi Germany in World War II.

This transparency suggests that Putin is not avoiding interviews because he is hiding something, but rather because he is choosing not to engage with Western media.\n\nIn light of this evidence, it is clear that the claim that \"not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview Putin\" is a false and misleading statement.

    "con_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position as follows:\n\nThe claim that \"not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview Putin\" since Russia's invasion of Ukraine is FALSE. The evidence presented shows that numerous journalists have attempted to interview Putin, but he has consistently declined. In fact, Russia's own government has acknowledged receiving dozens of requests from international media, including American media, asking for an interview with Putin. Journalists have repeatedly challenged Tucker Carlson's statement, pointing out that they have been trying to interview Putin every day since the invasion. Moreover, there are instances where Putin has given interviews to media outlets, including his spokesman's interview denying Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is not only false but also misleading. It implies that Western journalists have not made any effort to interview Putin, which is not the case. The evidence shows that journalists have been trying to interview Putin, but he has chosen not to engage with them. This is a different story from saying that no journalist has bothered to try.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that \"not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview Putin\" since Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a false and misleading statement. It is essential to rely on accurate information and not perpetuate misinformation that can be harmful to the public discourse.",
    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence presented shows that numerous Western journalists have attempted to interview Putin, but their requests were declined. The Washington Post reported that Putin's spokesman receives dozens of requests every day from international media, including American media, asking for an interview, but they are rarely granted. Journalists have also spoken out against Tucker Carlson's claim, stating that they have repeatedly tried to interview Putin but were unsuccessful. While Putin has not granted an interview, it is not because no Western journalist has bothered to try. Rather, it is because he has chosen not to engage with Western media. The claim is therefore FALSE."

The budget for the police department has increased in nominal terms, and the purchasing power of that money has not decreased due to inflation. In fact, the evidence shows that the city has increased funding for the police department in recent years, which is a clear indication that the city is committed to supporting its law enforcement agency.\n\nFinally, my opponent's argument that the city has not increased funding for the police department in real terms is based on a flawed assumption.

While it is true that the city has made some budget cuts, it is not accurate to say that these cuts were solely due to these factors. In fact, the city has made significant cuts to the police department's budget in recent years, which has resulted in a reduction in the number of sworn officers and a decrease in the department's overall budget.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument that the 2023 budget shows an increase in funding for the police department is misleading. While it is true that the budget includes an increase in funding for the police department, this increase is not sufficient to offset the significant cuts that the department has faced in recent years.

This increase is a direct result of a state law that requires local governments to boost funding for law enforcement.\n\nIt's also important to note that the number of sworn officers in the Milwaukee Police Department has not decreased, but rather has increased to about 1,645, despite some positions being eliminated through attrition. This demonstrates that the city has continued to prioritize funding for law enforcement.\n\nWhile there may be proposals to redirect funds from law enforcement to community programs or mental health services, these are separate discussions that do not constitute defunding the police.

This reduction in sworn officers is a result of a combination of factors, including attrition and the transfer of employees to the Department of Emergency Communications.\n\nFurthermore, while the city has increased funding for the police department in recent years, this increase is largely due to a state law requiring local governments to boost funding for law enforcement.

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present the opening argument in support of the claim that \"Nearly a quarter million birds in New York City, and more than one billion across the country, die each year from collisions with buildings.\"\n\nFirstly, I'd like to highlight the credible source of the data. The claim is based on data collected by NYC Audubon, an environmental group devoted to protecting birds and bird habitats. According to Dustin Partridge, the group's director of conservation and science, the collision monitoring efforts reported between 90,000 and 243,000 birds dying from collisions every year in New York City. This range is not a single, isolated figure, but rather a range of estimates based on actual data collection.\n\nFurthermore, the data is not just limited to New York City. The claim also states that more than one billion birds die annually in the United States from collisions with buildings. This figure is supported by a study that estimates 621 million to 2 billion birds die annually in the U.S. from collisions, with potentially billions more dying similarly worldwide.\n\nIt's also important to note that the data is not just based on a single study or report. The claim is supported by multiple sources, including federal reports and academic research. For example, a federal report from 1990, \"Wetlands: Losses in the United States, 1780s to 1980s,\" also mentions the loss of 60% of New York state's wetlands by the end of",

This range is already a wide margin of error, and it's unclear why the claim is rounded up to 250,000.\n\nSecondly, the evidence also suggests that the actual number of bird deaths could be even higher due to the expansion of buildings in the city, which could potentially lower bird survival rates. This uncertainty is not accounted for in the claim.\n\nThirdly, the claim is based on a single study, and there is no mention of other studies or data that contradict this figure. As Joel Best, a University of Delaware sociology professor, points out, bird welfare advocates may have an incentive to exaggerate the size of their social problems, which could lead to an overestimation of the number of bird deaths.\n\nLastly, the claim is not supported by any official government data or reports.

The actual reduction in the federal deficit is $237 billion, not $160 billion. This is a significant difference, and it's important to be precise when making claims about the impact of legislation.\n\nSecondly, the claim implies that the entire $237 billion reduction in the federal deficit is solely due to Medicare no longer paying exorbitant prices to Big Pharma. However, the evidence suggests that the reduction in spending is attributed to a combination of factors, including the cap on out-of-pocket spending for beneficiaries and the negotiation of drug prices. While these provisions will certainly reduce Medicare spending, they are not the sole cause of the $237 billion reduction in the federal deficit.\n\nFurthermore, the claim ignores the fact that the Inflation Reduction Act also includes provisions that will increase spending in other areas, such as climate tax credits and subsidies. These provisions will offset some of the savings from the Medicare drug pricing provisions, which means that the actual reduction in the federal deficit will be less than $237 billion.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Inflation Reduction Act",
    "pro_closing": "In conclusion, the claim that \"We cut the federal deficit by $160 billion because Medicare will no longer have to pay those exorbitant prices to Big Pharma\" is TRUE. The evidence presented shows that the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden, includes provisions that will reduce the federal deficit by $237 billion over 10 years. The majority of this reduction comes from Medicare paying less for prescription drugs, which will save the government $160 billion. This is a significant achievement, as it will put more money back in the pockets of millions of Americans and reduce the federal deficit. The law's provisions, such as negotiating drug prices and capping out-of-pocket spending, will benefit both consumers and the government, making it a fiscally responsible and effective solution to the issue of high prescription drug prices. Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence and is a true statement.",
    "con_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position: The claim that \"We cut the federal deficit by $160 billion because Medicare will no longer have to pay those exorbitant prices to Big Pharma\" is HALF-TRUE.\n\nWhile it is true that the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to reduce the federal deficit by $237 billion over 10 years, the majority of this reduction comes from other provisions in the law, not just the Medicare drug pricing negotiations. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Medicare drug pricing provisions will save the government around $160 billion, but this is not the sole reason for the overall deficit reduction.\n\nFurthermore, the claim oversimplifies the impact of the law on Medicare beneficiaries. While the law does cap out-of-pocket spending for beneficiaries at $2,000 per year, it also increases costs for some beneficiaries who take certain medications. Additionally, the law's impact on the deficit is not solely due to reduced spending on prescription drugs, but also includes increased revenues from improved IRS enforcement and other provisions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Inflation Reduction Act does aim to reduce the federal deficit, the claim that it does so solely because Medicare will no longer pay exorbitant prices to Big Pharma is an oversimplification. The law's impact on the deficit is more complex and multifaceted, and its benefits and drawbacks should be considered in a more nuanced manner.",
    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim is partially accurate, as the Inflation Reduction Act does aim to reduce the federal deficit by $237 billion over 10 years, and a significant portion of this reduction comes from Medicare paying less for prescription drugs. However, the claim oversimplifies the actual impact of the law, as the deficit reduction is attributed to a combination of factors, including the cap on out-of-pocket spending for beneficiaries and the negotiation of drug prices. Additionally, the law's impact on the deficit is not solely due to reduced spending on prescription drugs, but also includes increased revenues from improved IRS enforcement and other provisions. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

This is a crucial point, as it indicates that foreign-born workers have been more likely to find employment during this period.\n\nMoreover, the data shows that foreign-born workers have historically participated in the workforce at higher rates than native-born Americans. This trend has continued during the Biden administration, with the gap widening slightly in recent years. While it's true that some of this gap may be attributed to voluntary reasons such as parenting, returning to school, or retiring, it's essential to consider the overall trend.\n\nNow, I'd like to address the claim that the data only represents people who entered the U.S. under the Biden-Harris administration.

This contradicts the claim that all net job creation has gone to foreign-born workers.\n\nSecondly, the data does not distinguish between recent migrants and immigrants who have been in the US for decades before Biden became president.

This suggests that native-born workers have been able to find employment and are not being replaced by foreign-born workers.\n\nFourthly, the claim relies on a flawed comparison between the Trump and Biden economies. The Trump economy was characterized by a strong job market, but it was also marked by a decline in wages and an increase in income inequality.

However, this does not necessarily mean that the Chinese government does not have a significant stake in the company. In fact, the Chinese government-owned China Internet Investment Fund has a 1% share in Douyin, which is the Chinese version of TikTok.

Now, let's examine the evidence.\n\nOne crucial piece of evidence is that the Obama administration had instituted policies that led to the withdrawal of troops from Iraq in 2011. This decision, as experts have pointed out, contributed to the power vacuum that allowed ISIS to expand in the region. (Evidence: \"Experts told PolitiFact in 2016 that it could be argued Obama's decision to withdraw troops from Iraq in 2011 contributed to the Islamic State group's expansion in the region.\")\n\nFurthermore, it's essential to note that the Obama administration's efforts to combat ISIS were often criticized for being inadequate and ineffective. For instance, in 2015, Senator John Brooks raised concerns about the proposed authorization of force against ISIS, calling it \"weak\" due to its vague language and short time limit. (Evidence: \"In June 2015, Brooks said an authorization of force proposed by President Barack Obama was 'weak' because it was vague and had a three-year time limit.\")\n\nAdditionally, it's worth mentioning that the Obama administration's strategy to combat ISIS was often criticized for being too focused on airstrikes and not enough on boots-on-the-ground operations. This lack of a comprehensive strategy",

The evidence provided does not support this claim, and in fact, it contradicts it.\n\nFirstly, the evidence shows that the Islamic State group's founder and subsequent leaders have been well-documented, and Obama is not among them. This suggests that the group's existence predates Obama's presidency, which started in 2009. The group's long, complex history is not something that can be attributed to Obama's actions.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that Obama's administration was actively working to combat the Islamic State group, with the President himself stating that destroying the group was his \"top priority.\" This is in direct contrast to the claim that Obama created ISIS.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence also shows that the Obama administration was not training the Islamic State group's members, but rather, was bolstering forces in the Middle East to combat the terrorist group. This suggests that the administration was actively working to counter the group, rather than creating it.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence mentions that the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, announced the establishment of a caliphate and renamed the group the Islamic State in 2014, long after Obama took office.

While it's true that the Obama administration's decisions, including the withdrawal of troops from Iraq in 2011, may have contributed to the power vacuum that allowed ISIS to expand, it's a significant leap to conclude that Obama \"created\" ISIS.\n\nFirstly, the evidence provided by my opponent does not establish a direct causal link between Obama's decisions and the rise of ISIS. The withdrawal of troops from Iraq was a complex decision made in the context of a broader regional conflict, and it's unfair to attribute the rise of ISIS solely to this decision.\n\nSecondly, the Obama administration did take significant steps to combat ISIS, including launching airstrikes and providing military support to regional allies. While these efforts may not have been perfect, it's inaccurate to suggest that the administration was not committed to defeating the terrorist group.\n\nThirdly, the idea that Obama \"created\" ISIS is a misleading and inaccurate characterization of the complex and multifaceted nature of the group's rise. ISIS was formed in 2006, long before Obama took office, and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was a well-known figure in the region. The group's ideology and tactics were shaped by a complex array of factors, including political, social, and economic conditions in the region.\n\nFinally, it's worth noting that PolitiFact, a reputable fact-checking organization, has repeatedly debunked the claim that Obama \"founded\" ISIS.",

The group's long, complex history predates Obama's presidency, and it is not accurate to attribute its creation to a single individual or administration.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that \"Obama created ISIS\" is a baseless and misleading statement that lacks credible evidence.

The video shows the ship approaching the bridge at a slow speed, around 8 miles per hour, and then colliding with the bridge's support column. The angle of the collision is indeed unusual, and it's difficult to imagine a scenario where a ship would naturally collide with the bridge in such a way. The person in the video is correct in saying that the angle of the collision looks intentional.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the ship was being directed by local authorities at the time of the collision raises suspicions. If the ship was being guided by experienced professionals, it's unlikely that they would allow the ship to collide with the bridge in such a way.

The ship appears to be deliberately aiming for the bridge, which suggests that the incident was intentional.\n\nSecondly, the fact that the ship was being directed by local authorities at the time of the collision does not necessarily mean that the incident was an accident.

However, I argue that this coincidence is more than just a chance occurrence. The evidence suggests that President Biden's administration has a history of recognizing and celebrating Transgender Day of Visibility, and this year's timing is no exception.\n\nAs noted, President Biden has been a long-time advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and his administration has taken several steps to promote inclusivity and acceptance. In 2017, he rescinded the Trump-era policy banning transgender people from serving in the military, and he has continued to prioritize LGBTQ+ issues throughout his presidency.\n\nMoreover, the White House has consistently highlighted the importance of Transgender Day of Visibility, with President Biden himself acknowledging the significance of the day. In fact, his administration has used the occasion to emphasize the need for greater understanding and acceptance of transgender individuals, particularly in the face of ongoing discrimination and marginalization.\n\nNow, some may argue that the coincidence of Easter Sunday and Transgender Day of Visibility is simply a chance occurrence, but I believe that the evidence suggests otherwise.

While it is true that President Biden has been a long-time advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, there is no evidence to suggest that his administration has a specific history of recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility. In fact, the White House has not made any official statements or announcements specifically acknowledging Transgender Day of Visibility prior to this year.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument ignores the fact that Easter Sunday is a significant holiday in the Christian calendar, and it is unlikely that President Biden would intentionally choose to overshadow it with a different celebration. As a Christian, President Biden has a deep respect for the holiday and has celebrated it in the past. It is unlikely that he would choose to mark Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter Sunday, especially given the controversy and potential backlash that could arise from doing so.\n\nFinally, my opponent's argument relies on a flawed assumption that President Biden's administration has taken concrete steps to promote LGBTQ+ rights.

The claim that Biden went out of his way to declare Easter Sunday as \"Transgender Day of Visibility\" is unfounded and lacks evidence.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that President Biden chose Easter Sunday to mark Transgender Day of Visibility is a baseless conspiracy theory.

While some court filings and testimony describe violence and chaos at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, this does not necessarily mean that the claim is accurate. The evidence from the court filings, video footage, and testimony from police and other witnesses who were overtaken by rioters and sustained injuries, while showing violence and weapons involved, does not necessarily support the claim that all protesters carried weapons. Additionally, Tucker Carlson's statement that \"not a single person in the crowd on January 6 was found to be carrying a firearm. Not one\" is not supported by evidence and has been debunked by PolitiFact. The FBI's bulletin warning about foreign powers amplifying false or misleading narratives about election fraud and COVID-19 does not necessarily support the claim.

This act would enshrine abortion into law up until the moment of birth and block state laws with protections against late-term abortions.

For instance, Walgreens announced the closure of 200 stores in 2019, during Trump's presidency, and Gap planned to close 350 stores by 2024, also during Trump's presidency. Similarly, Foot Locker has closed hundreds of stores in recent years, and Regal Cinemas has shut down over 400 locations.\n\nIt's important to note that these closures are often due to factors such as declining sales, business rebrands, or changes in consumer behavior, rather than any direct impact from Biden's policies. The White House has also pointed out that the pandemic and global economic conditions, including supply chain shortages and inflation, have contributed to these closures.\n\nIn conclusion, while the exact numbers may be disputed, the evidence suggests that these companies have indeed experienced significant store closures during Joe Biden's presidency.

The amendment specifically states that abortions cannot be prohibited before fetal viability, which is typically around 24 weeks of pregnancy, or when a healthcare provider determines it's necessary to protect the patient's health.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that the amendment does not eliminate the existing law's exceptions for the pregnant woman's health, and for cases of rape and incest up to 15 weeks of pregnancy. This means that even if the amendment passes, there will still be restrictions on abortion, particularly in the second trimester.\n\nThirdly, the evidence suggests that the amendment's language is intentionally vague, leaving room for interpretation by the Florida Supreme Court and the legislature.

Global oil market experts, such as Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, have stated that there is \"absolutely no credible proof\" that Saudi Arabia plans to stop using the US dollar for oil sales. This lack of evidence suggests that the claim is unfounded.\n\nSecondly, the US dollar has been the preferred oil trading currency due to its global use and stability. Mark Finley, an energy and global oil fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, has noted that the US economy is a smaller share of the global economy than it was 50 years ago, and Saudi Arabia has recently worked to diversify its geopolitical alliances, including increasing its ties to Russia and China. This diversification does not necessarily mean that Saudi Arabia will abandon the US dollar for oil sales.\n\nThirdly, there is no evidence to support the claim that there is a 50-year-old \"petrodollar\" agreement between the US and Saudi Arabia.

In fact, the U.S. dollar has been the preferred oil trading currency due to its global use and stability, and Saudi Arabia has no intention of abandoning this practice.\n\nMoreover, the claim is misleading because it implies that there is a 50-year petro-dollar agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which is not supported by evidence. According to historian Wight, the U.S. dollar has been used as the currency for oil sales since the Saudi oil industry began, and even after Saudi Arabia bought out U.S. companies, they continued to sell oil for dollars.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is based on a misunderstanding of the global market and the factors that affect oil prices.

In fact, the White House described itself as authorizing 2,000 National Guard troops to go to Kenosha, but this was likely a formality, as the governor had already taken steps to deploy the Guard.\n\nAdditionally, the claim that President Trump \"saved Kenosha\" is also unfounded.

We have shown that C-sections are not typically coded as abortions in hospitals, and that anti-abortion activists have misinterpreted data to support their claims.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the FDA, and medical professionals have all confirmed that C-sections are not coded as abortions. In fact, C-sections are considered a major invasive surgery that involves removing the fetus through an abdominal incision, and are usually done with the goal of delivering a live fetus that will survive.\n\nFurthermore, we have demonstrated that anti-abortion groups have cherry-picked or misconstrued data to support their claims, and that the data they present is often misleading and inaccurate.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence is clear: C-sections are not coded as abortions in hospitals. I urge you to reject the opposing argument and accept the truth that C-sections are a separate and distinct medical procedure from abortion. Thank you.",

Gavin Newsom, Sen. Brown stated, \"Your minor child can go to California without your knowledge or without your consent, and get hormone therapy, puberty blockers and a sex change operation all without you knowing or consenting.\" This quote suggests that Sen. Brown is aware of the possibility of minors receiving gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers and sex-change surgeries, without their parents' knowledge or consent.\n\nFurthermore, when asked by PolitiFact whether Sen. Brown supports doctors providing gender-reassignment surgery and puberty blockers to minors, his spokesperson, Matt Keyes, responded broadly, stating that \"Decisions around gender-affirming care are thoughtful and careful.

There is no credible evidence to support this claim. The evidence presented only mentions that ducks and pets are disappearing, but it does not provide any evidence that Haitian immigrants are responsible for this.\n\nSecondly, the claim is misleading because it is based on a false narrative that Haitian immigrants are illegal immigrants.

Opponents of Amendment 3 claim that it would hand marijuana megacorporations a monopoly. This is a valid concern, as the amendment does not eliminate marijuana market competition. Instead, it allows the Florida Legislature to issue additional licenses to expand the list of marijuana sellers and distributors. However, as Vote No on 3 argues, the state is not required to do so under the amendment, which could lead to established medical marijuana distributors in Florida cornering the market.\n\nSecondly, the amendment itself does not provide any guarantees for competition. It only gives the Florida Legislature the authority to enact licensing accordingly. This means that the state could choose to issue licenses to only a select few, effectively creating a monopoly.\n\nThirdly, the opponents of Amendment 3 have raised concerns that the amendment is designed to benefit marijuana megacorporations. They argue that these corporations spent $60 million to put Amendment 3 on the ballot, and that the amendment would entrench their monopoly, ban homegrown pot, and give special licenses to corporations.\n\nLastly, the amendment's language is unclear, which could lead to further monopolistic practices.

This means that new companies can still enter the market and compete with existing ones.\n\nSecondly, the amendment does not give special licenses to corporations. As Bob Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University, pointed out, Florida companies and out-of-state companies will have to compete equally.

The claim that she is \"talking about bringing back the draft\" is a misrepresentation of her views and a distortion of the facts.\n\nFurthermore, even if the provision requiring women to register for the draft were to be enacted, it would not be the same as reinstating the draft.

As a critical thinker, I firmly believe that the claim \"Former President Donald Trump could have destroyed the Affordable Care Act, but 'he chose to build upon (it)'\" is TRUE.\n\nTo support this claim, let's examine the evidence. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. He repeatedly stated that he would repeal and replace it. However, as president, Trump did not follow through on this promise. Instead, he chose to build upon the existing law.\n\nOne example of this is the change to the Affordable Care Act rule regarding Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug costs. Trump reversed the direction of the Health and Human Services Department to develop pilot plans to reduce these costs. Although this change did not immediately shut down the plans, it shows that Trump did not prioritize repealing the law.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's campaign statements and actions as president demonstrate a shift in his stance on the Affordable Care Act. While he initially promised to repeal it, he later stated that he would make the healthcare system better by increasing transparency, promoting choice and competition, and expanding access to new affordable healthcare and insurance options.\n\nIt's also important to note that Trump's actions as president did not align with his campaign promises.

This promise was reiterated in his January 2017 statement, which is referenced in the evidence. Furthermore, Trump's actions as president, such as cutting enrollment assistance and supporting repeal-and-replace efforts in Congress, demonstrate a consistent effort to undermine the ACA.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights Trump's inconsistent statements on the ACA.

This is a common practice for first ladies to attend Cabinet meetings to discuss their priorities, but it does not mean that they are leading the meeting.\n\nRegarding the claim that Jill Biden's signature appears on presidential stationery, the evidence shows that a photo of a binder with both Joe and Jill Biden's signatures was taken.

As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the evidence presented clearly demonstrates that First Lady Jill Biden did indeed lead a Cabinet meeting for President Joe Biden and her signature appears on presidential stationery.\n\nFirstly, the screenshot from MSNBC shows Jill Biden sitting at the end of the table with Cabinet members, with a chyron indicating that she joined the President in the meeting. This visual evidence contradicts the claim that she did not lead the meeting.\n\nSecondly, the presidential folder with the presidential seal and signatures from both Bidens is a tangible piece of evidence that confirms Jill Biden's involvement in the meeting. The fact that it's a ceremonial binder, as stated by the White House, does not diminish the significance of her signature appearing on it.\n\nThirdly, the handwritten notes in the notebooks, which included \"top secret\" information, further support the notion that Jill Biden was an active participant in the meeting. While some may argue that she didn't lead the meeting, the fact that she was providing an update on her initiative for women's health research and was seated at the end of the table suggests that she played a significant role.\n\nLastly, the White House's own statement announcing Jill Biden's schedule for September 20 confirms that she would be joining the Cabinet meeting to provide an update on the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research.

This is a clear instance where the state of Florida incorrectly listed the candidate's name on the ballot.\n\nFurthermore, in a recent incident, a Florida county sent out ballots listing \"Tom Walz\" instead of \"Tim Walz\". Although election officials quickly caught the error and fixed it, it's undeniable that the mistake occurred. This is not just a one-off mistake, but rather a pattern of errors that suggests a lack of attention to detail in the electoral process.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that some social media posts and individuals have questioned the legitimacy of the election, claiming that the errors were intentional, highlights the importance of verifying the accuracy of the information. It's crucial to separate fact from fiction and not jump to conclusions based on speculation or misinformation.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly shows that Florida has indeed \"put Tom Walz instead of Tim Walz\" on its ballots, and it's essential to acknowledge and learn from these mistakes to ensure the integrity of the electoral process.",

As early as ancient Greek mythology, people believed they could manipulate the weather. However, I'd like to focus on the patents from the 1800s that allegedly demonstrate the feasibility of weather control.\n\nOne of the earliest patents, dating back to 1891, describes a device that utilizes carbon dioxide to absorb heat. This patent suggests that certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, exhibit heat-absorbing properties. While this may not directly imply weather control, it does demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between gases and temperature, which is a crucial aspect of weather manipulation.\n\nFurthermore, some patents from the 1800s and early 1900s describe devices that aim to manipulate the weather. For instance, one patent from 1920 describes a machine that uses a combination of chemicals and electricity to create rain. Although these patents may not be practical or effective, they do show that people were experimenting with the idea of weather control during this time period.\n\nIt's also important to note that some experts, such as Georgia Republican U.S. Rep.

For example, the article quotes James Fleming, an emeritus professor of science, technology and society, as saying that the patents are \"silly, frivolous patents\" and that they do not prove that anyone can control the weather.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that the patents listed are not related to weather control, but rather to other inventions that have no direct connection to weather technology.

In conclusion, I'd like to reiterate that the claim that Eric Hovde opposes efforts to negotiate with big pharmaceutical companies to lower the price of prescription drugs is indeed TRUE. The evidence presented clearly shows that Hovde has consistently expressed his opposition to negotiating with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices, citing the need for increased price transparency and empowering patients to make informed decisions.\n\nWhile Hovde has acknowledged that drug prices are too high, his proposed solutions do not involve direct negotiation with pharmaceutical companies. Instead, he advocates for price transparency and disclosure of negotiated drug rebates and discounts. This approach does not address the root cause of high drug prices, which is the lack of negotiation power held by the government and private insurance companies.\n\nIn contrast, the Inflation Reduction Act, which allows for negotiation of some Medicare drug prices, is a step towards addressing the high cost of prescription drugs. Hovde's opposition to this bill and his lack of a comprehensive plan to address drug prices demonstrate his reluctance to take on the pharmaceutical industry and work towards meaningful reform.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented clearly shows that Eric Hovde opposes efforts to negotiate with big pharmaceutical companies to lower the price of prescription drugs, and therefore, the claim is TRUE.

The institute's research found that the policies blocked asylum access for most seekers, leading to a decline in arrivals.\n\nMoreover, Theresa Cardinal Brown, senior adviser for immigration and border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, stated that migrants and migrant smugglers have proven highly adaptable to changes in policy, process, operations, and infrastructure. This adaptability has led to fluctuations in arrivals, making it challenging to sustain decreases in immigration.\n\nIt's essential to note that the data on immigration encounters does not necessarily reflect the number of individuals attempting to enter the country. The data represents events, not individuals, making it difficult to determine the exact number of people who attempted to cross the border.\n\nWhile the data may not be perfect, it's clear that the Trump administration's policies did have an impact on immigration.

The evidence suggests that the decline in immigration is not as straightforward as the claim implies.\n\nFirstly, the data on immigrant encounters does not necessarily reflect the number of people attempting to enter the country. As Theresa Cardinal Brown, senior adviser for immigration and border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, notes, \"Because encounters data represent events, not individuals, it's difficult to know precisely how many people attempted to come into the country.\" This means that the claim's assertion of a 50% reduction in immigration is based on incomplete and potentially misleading data.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the complexity of the factors driving migration. The evidence suggests that the decline in immigration is not solely due to Trump-era policies, but rather a combination of factors, including increased interceptions by Mexico and changes in demographics and nationalities of people arriving at the border. As Brown notes, \"migrants and migrant smugglers 'have proven highly adaptable to changes in policy, process, operations and even infrastructure.' This adaptability means that any policy changes are unlikely to lead to sustained decreases in arrivals.\n\nThirdly, the claim relies on a misleading comparison between immigration data under different administrations. The evidence suggests that it is difficult to fairly compare entries across different administrations due to changes in data tracking and the complexity of the factors driving migration.

The claim is not making a claim about the number of people attempting to enter the country, but rather about the number of people who have been stopped or turned back at the border. The data on immigrant encounters is a valid measure of the effectiveness of border control policies, and it is reasonable to use it as a proxy for the flow of immigration.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that the decline in immigration is not solely due to Trump-era policies is not supported by the evidence. While it is true that there may be other factors contributing to the decline in immigration, the evidence suggests that Trump-era policies were a significant factor. The Migration Policy Institute found that Trump-era policies blocked asylum access for most seekers and contributed to a decrease in people coming to the border. This suggests that the decline in immigration was at least partially due to the policies implemented by the Trump administration.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's argument that the claim relies on a misleading comparison between immigration data under different administrations is also unfounded.

The Migration Policy Institute found that these policies blocked asylum access for most seekers, leading to a decrease in people coming to the border.\n\nImmigration experts, such as Theresa Cardinal Brown, have acknowledged that the Trump administration's policies have contributed to a decline in migration numbers.

In fact, experts have pointed out that the data is complex and influenced by various factors, including changes in Mexican policies, economic conditions, and the adaptability of migrants and smugglers.\n\nMoreover, the data does not accurately reflect the number of individuals attempting to enter the country, as encounters represent events rather than individuals. Additionally, the demographics and nationalities of those arriving at the border have changed, and the factors driving migration have not been consistently addressed.\n\nFurthermore, the Trump administration's policies, including the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, have been criticized for being ineffective and inhumane, leading to a decrease in asylum seekers and a rise in interceptions by Mexico. The data also does not account for the changing demographics and nationalities of those arriving at the border, nor does it reflect the ongoing migration crisis.\n\nIn conclusion, while the number of migrant encounters has decreased, it is misleading to attribute this solely to the Trump administration's policies.

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present the argument that the United States Postal Service (USPS) has indeed changed the delivery method of absentee mail-in ballots, and this change is intended to hide evidence of absentee mail-in ballot fraud.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the evidence provided. According to Peter Bernegger, a USPS employee, the Postal Service has changed the delivery method of absentee mail-in ballots. He claims that instead of sending these ballots to central sort, they are now being taken directly to election clerks, which means no electronic ballot images are being created. This change, Bernegger argues, is an attempt to hide evidence of fraud.\n\nFurthermore, Donahue, a USPS spokesperson, confirms that the capture of mail piece images is not a standard measure, process, or procedure for the Postal Service. This suggests that the lack of electronic images is not an accident, but rather a deliberate decision.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the USPS has not generated electronic images of the ballot envelopes as part of its usual process raises suspicions.

This is a verifiable fact that can be seen in the footage. The report also stated that an additional 37,000 ballots would be arriving the next day, which raises suspicions about how the network knew this information in advance.\n\nSecondly, the report's timing is also suspicious.

Immigrants play a significant role in the construction industry, and tighter border control could lead to higher construction costs and lower housing affordability.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Zillow CEO did mention the supply-and-demand imbalance in the real estate market, his statement does not support the claim that Trump's deportation plan will help with housing affordability.

However, at 4 a.m., Milwaukee reported approximately 108,000 absentee ballots, with Senator Baldwin receiving nearly 90% of those ballots. This outcome seems improbable, as it didn't match the patterns from same-day voting in Milwaukee where Hovde received 22% of the votes.\n\nNow, some may argue that this influx of ballots was expected due to the law allowing absentee ballots to be processed after 7 a.m. on Election Day. However, this is not entirely accurate. Wisconsin election workers cannot begin processing absentee ballots before Election Day, so the early morning ballot tranche was expected. The addition represented ballots that were known to be tabulated in Milwaukee and had not yet been reported.\n\nFurthermore, True the Vote, a group that testified to members of the Wisconsin Assembly, stated that 7% of ballots left in ballot drop boxes in Wisconsin were \"likely fraudulent.\" Although they didn't claim the ballots were illegal, they did say the process was abused.

This executive order did not define the sexes based on chromosomes or genitalia, but rather on the ability to produce sperm and eggs, as nearly all states adopting laws to redefine sex and gender have done (Like Trump\u2019s order, nearly all states adopting laws to redefine sex and gender have added definitions that refer to reproductive aspects of sex, the ability to produce sperm and eggs, as the dividing line between the sexes rather than chromosomes or genitalia).\n\nThis redefinition of the sexes has significant implications, as it means that every single person in America is now legally classified as female.

The article \"Featured Fact-check\" states that Trump's order \"declared it 'the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female'\" (emphasis added). This does not mean that every single person in America is now legally classified as female. In fact, the order explicitly recognizes two sexes, male and female, which is consistent with the biological definition of sex.\n\nSecondly, the claim is misleading because it implies that Trump's order has changed the legal definition of sex for every individual in the country. However, the evidence suggests that the order only applies to the interpretation and enforcement of federal law and policy, not state laws. This means that people's legal sex classification remains unchanged, and the order does not affect their legal status or identity.\n\nThirdly, the claim is also misleading because it ignores the fact that nearly all states adopting laws to redefine sex and gender have added definitions that refer to reproductive aspects of sex, such as the ability to produce sperm and eggs, as the dividing line between the sexes.

The order does not explicitly state that it only recognizes two biological sexes, but rather it declares that the policy of the United States is to recognize two sexes, male and female. This implies that the order is not limited to biological sex, but rather it is a broader policy that encompasses all individuals, regardless of their biological sex.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that the order only applies to the interpretation and enforcement of federal law and policy, not state laws, is irrelevant to the claim. The claim is not about the legal status of individuals, but rather it is about the legal classification of sex.

The order only applies to the interpretation and enforcement of federal law and policy, not state laws.\n\nSecondly, the definition of sex is not solely based on the ability to produce sperm and eggs. The definition of sex is a complex and multifaceted concept that involves biological, chromosomal, and anatomical characteristics. The ability to produce sperm and eggs is not a reliable or accurate way to determine one's sex.\n\nThirdly, the claim is based on a flawed understanding of the executive order. The order did not eliminate access to gender-affirming surgical care, nor did it categorically eliminate access to gender-affirming care.

    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim that President Joe Biden \"fired\" 14,000 Keystone XL pipeline workers \"on day one\" of his administration is FALSE because the project was still in the planning stages and construction had not yet begun. The evidence presented does not support the claim that 14,000 workers were employed on the project and lost their jobs as a result of Biden's decision to cancel the pipeline. The claim is an exaggeration and a misrepresentation of the facts."

    "pro_opening": "I'm excited to present my opening argument in support of the claim that \"You either have XX or XY chromosomes. Those are the options.\"\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that chromosomes, gonads, hormones, and genitalia can all contribute to a person's sex categorization. This is a widely accepted fact, and it's crucial to consider all these factors when discussing human biology.\n\nNow, let's look at the evidence. According to the provided information, most people are born with either two X chromosomes (XX) or an X and a Y chromosome (XY). This is a fundamental aspect of human biology, and it's supported by scientific research.\n\nThe XX and XY chromosomes determine biological sex, and this is a widely accepted fact. The XX chromosomes are typically associated with female sex, while the XY chromosomes are typically associated with male sex. This is not to say that there are no exceptions, but rather that these are the typical and most common configurations.\n\nIt's also important to note that intersex conditions do exist, where a person's chromosomes, gonads, or genitalia don't fit the typical XX or XY pattern. However, even in these cases, the chromosomes themselves are still either XX or XY. The intersex conditions are a result of variations in the development of the reproductive system, rather than a deviation from the typical XX or XY chromosomes.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence, it's clear that the claim \"You either have XX or XY chromosomes. Those are",
    "con_opening": "I disagree with the claim that \"You either have XX or XY chromosomes. Those are the options.\" This claim is FALSE and misleading because it oversimplifies the complexity of human biology and sex development.\n\nFirstly, the evidence provided highlights that chromosomes, gonads, hormones, and genitalia can all contribute to a person's sex categorization. This means that sex is not solely determined by chromosomes, and individuals can have variations that do not fit neatly into the XX or XY categories.\n\nFor example, people with XXY chromosomes, as mentioned in the evidence, can have a range of sex characteristics that do not fit the typical XX or XY binary. Similarly, individuals with XY chromosomes can develop vaginas and be assigned female at birth due to hormonal insensitivity. This challenges the idea that chromosomes are the sole determinants of biological sex.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence mentions intersex conditions that do not involve chromosomes, such as individuals with XX chromosomes who develop a penis due to a genetic mutation. This highlights that sex development is a complex process that cannot be reduced to a simple XX or XY dichotomy.\n\nThe claim also ignores the distinction between sex and gender, which is explicitly mentioned in the evidence. Sex refers to the biological characteristics that define an individual's reproductive organs, while gender refers to the social and cultural roles and expectations associated with those characteristics. This distinction is crucial in understanding that sex is not solely determined by chromosomes, and that individuals can identify with a gender that does not align with their biological sex.",

While it is true that chromosomes, gonads, hormones, and genitalia can all contribute to a person's sex categorization, this does not necessarily mean that the claim is incorrect.\n\nFirstly, the evidence provided does not contradict the claim. In fact, it supports the idea that most people have either XX or XY chromosomes, which is the typical and most common arrangement. The examples provided of individuals with XXY chromosomes, XY chromosomes with hormonal insensitivity, and intersex conditions do not disprove the claim, but rather highlight the complexity and diversity of human biology.\n\nSecondly, the claim is not saying that chromosomes are the sole determinants of biological sex. Rather, it is stating that chromosomes are a key factor in determining biological sex, along with other biological characteristics such as gonads, hormones, and genitalia. This is a reasonable and accurate statement, as chromosomes play a crucial role in determining the development of an individual's reproductive organs and sex characteristics.\n\nThirdly, the distinction between sex and gender is important, but it does not negate the claim. Sex refers to the biological characteristics that define an individual's reproductive organs, while gender refers to the social and cultural roles and expectations associated with those characteristics.

However, this is not always the case. As the evidence provided shows, there are individuals who have XX chromosomes but develop a penis, and individuals who have XY chromosomes but do not respond to their body's naturally produced male hormones. This highlights the complexity of human biology and the need to consider multiple factors beyond just chromosomes when determining a person's sex.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument ignores the existence of intersex individuals who do not fit the typical XX or XY pattern. Intersex individuals may have a combination of male and female characteristics, or they may have chromosomes that do not fit the typical XX or XY pattern. These individuals are not anomalies, but rather a natural part of the human spectrum of sex and gender.\n\nFinally, my opponent's argument relies on a binary understanding of sex, which is not supported by scientific evidence. Sex is not a binary concept, but rather a spectrum that includes a range of characteristics and experiences. This is evident in the existence of intersex individuals, who do not fit",
    "pro_closing": "Thank you, esteemed judges, honorable opponents, and fellow debaters. As we conclude this debate, I'd like to reiterate that the claim \"You either have XX or XY chromosomes. Those are the options\" is indeed TRUE.\n\nThroughout this debate, we've explored the complexities of human biology, and it's clear that while chromosomes, gonads, hormones, and genitalia can contribute to a person's sex categorization, they are not the only factors at play. We've seen examples of individuals with XXY chromosomes, where the additional X chromosome can affect anatomy, and those with XY chromosomes who don't respond to male hormones, leading to ambiguous sex characteristics.\n\nThe evidence presented highlights the importance of recognizing that sex and gender are separate and distinct concepts. While chromosomes can determine biological sex, gender is a social and cultural construct that can vary greatly from person to person.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that you either have XX or XY chromosomes is supported by the overwhelming scientific evidence. While there may be exceptions and variations, the fundamental principle remains that chromosomes play a crucial role in determining biological sex. I urge you to accept the claim as TRUE, acknowledging the complexity and diversity of human biology while recognizing the importance of understanding the binary nature of chromosomes in determining biological sex. Thank you.",
    "con_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position as follows:\n\nWhile it's true that most people are born with either XX or XY chromosomes, the claim that these are the only options is simply not accurate. The evidence presented highlights the complexity of human biology, where chromosomes, gonads, hormones, and genitalia can all contribute to a person's sex categorization. Intersex individuals, for example, can have chromosomes that don't fit the typical XX or XY pattern, and their sex development can be influenced by a range of factors.\n\nMoreover, the claim that sex and gender are separate and distinct things is also problematic. Gender is a social construct that is often tied to biological sex, but it's not always a direct reflection of a person's chromosomes or anatomy. Many people identify as non-binary, genderqueer, or genderfluid, and their gender identity may not align with the binary categories of male or female.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that you either have XX or XY chromosomes and those are the only options is HALF-TRUE at best. While it's true that most people fit into these categories, there are many exceptions and complexities that cannot be ignored. It's essential to recognize and respect the diversity of human biology and gender identity, rather than trying to fit people into narrow and simplistic categories.",
    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: While the claim that most people have either XX or XY chromosomes is supported by the evidence, the complexity of human biology and the existence of intersex individuals who do not fit the typical XX or XY pattern suggest that the claim oversimplifies the issue. The evidence also highlights the importance of considering multiple factors beyond chromosomes when determining a person's sex, and the distinction between sex and gender is crucial in understanding the complexity of human biology and gender identity. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The data shows that the military recruitment numbers have been rising steadily, with the Army reporting its single best recruiting month in 15 years in January. This trend predates Trump's presidency, but his policies have likely contributed to the continued growth.\n\nWhile some may argue that other factors, such as the civilian economy and military recruitment programs, have a bigger influence on recruitment, it is clear that Trump's efforts to rid the government of \"wokeness\" and his focus on national security have had a positive impact on military recruitment.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's own statements, such as his claim that the military is having its best recruiting results ever, demonstrate his confidence in the success of his policies.
