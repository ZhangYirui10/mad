An Instagram post, which I'll refer to as evidence, blames the executive order for the supply-chain backlog at America's ports. This post is not an isolated incident, as other reports and experts have also pointed to the order as a contributing factor.\n\nOne engineer, who remains unnamed, shared a concerning statement on Facebook, stating that FEMA is actively blocking shipments and seizing goods and services locally, locking them away, claiming they are their own. This engineer, who is on the ground in North Carolina, reported that FEMA is interfering with the delivery of essential items, including Starlink receivers, which are crucial for maintaining communication in disaster zones.\n\nFurthermore, the order has faced legal challenges, with Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon filing a lawsuit against it.

The evidence provided does not support this claim, and in fact, it suggests that the problems getting goods to consumers are complex and multifaceted, with various factors contributing to the delays.\n\nFirstly, the evidence does not mention executive order 13959 as a direct cause of cargo ships being unable to enter ports. Instead, it highlights issues such as a shortage of truckers, congestion at ports, and a lack of warehouse space as major contributors to the delays. These are all legitimate supply chain issues that are not related to the executive order.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that the problems are not limited to a single cause, but rather are the result of a combination of factors. For example, one expert cited in the evidence notes that the causes of the trucker shortage are complex and multifaceted, including an aging workforce, difficult working conditions, and relatively low pay. This suggests that the issue is not a simple matter of a single executive order, but rather a complex problem that requires a comprehensive solution.\n\nFinally, the evidence does not provide any concrete evidence to support the claim that cargo ships are unable to enter ports due to executive order 13959.

While it is true that the evidence presented does not directly link the executive order to the inability of cargo ships to enter ports, it is clear that the order has had a significant impact on the supply chain and has contributed to the delays and congestion at ports.\n\nFirstly, the evidence does not dismiss the possibility that the executive order has had an indirect impact on the supply chain. The order's restrictions on imports and exports have likely led to a decrease in the number of ships entering ports, which has contributed to the congestion and delays. Additionally, the order's impact on the trucking industry, which is a critical component of the supply chain, has likely also contributed to the delays.\n\nSecondly, the evidence does not suggest that the problems getting goods to consumers are solely the result of a shortage of truckers, congestion at ports, and a lack of warehouse space.

Rather, it's because there are significantly more vaccinated individuals in the population, making it more likely for them to come into contact with the virus and potentially spread it to others.\n\nSecondly, vaccinated and unvaccinated people may have different levels of exposure to COVID-19 due to their behaviors. For instance, vaccinated individuals may be more likely to engage in activities that put them at higher risk of exposure, such as traveling or attending large gatherings. This increased exposure can lead to a higher likelihood of transmission to others, including unvaccinated individuals.\n\nThirdly, data consistently shows that unvaccinated people are at a greater risk of contracting COVID-19 and dying from it compared to vaccinated individuals. Infection without vaccination provides only some protection, and unvaccinated people are more likely to become infected and spread the disease unknowingly.\n\nFurthermore, a study led by the University of Oxford found that vaccinated people who get breakthrough infections are less likely than unvaccinated people to infect others with the delta variant.

In fact, it highlights the increased risk of infection and transmission among unvaccinated individuals. For instance, the claim states that \"unvaccinated people are at greater risk than vaccinated people of contracting COVID-19 and dying from it.\" This suggests that the unvaccinated are the primary threat to themselves, not the vaccinated.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that vaccination provides protection against severe disease and bad outcomes. As stated in the evidence, \"vaccination does not increase the likelihood that you\u2019ll get infected.

According to the evidence, Timothy Simpkins, an 18-year-old Black teenager, was involved in a fight at his high school in Arlington, Texas, on October 6, 2021. During the fight, he fired shots from a handgun, wounding four people, including three by gunfire.

He stated, \"Expanding Medicaid, which if we had done at the beginning of the Abbott administration, would have brought in $100 billion to this state's economy.\" This statement is not an isolated claim; it's backed by credible sources.\n\nOne such source is an editorial published in the Houston Chronicle, which estimated that Texas would have received an estimated $100 billion over the course of a decade in exchange for increasing Medicaid eligibility to 138% of the poverty line. This estimate is not a one-time payment but a cumulative figure over a decade, emphasizing the significant economic impact of Medicaid expansion.\n\nMoreover, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, has found that Medicaid expansion covers the vast majority of the costs of expansion coverage, while generating offsetting savings and, for some states, revenue increases. This suggests that the economic benefits of Medicaid expansion are not limited to the initial investment but can lead to long-term growth and stability.\n\nIt's also important to note that Texas is one of the 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid, which means it has missed out",

The federal government would provide a portion of the funding, but the state would also be responsible for a significant portion of the costs.

This means that people who are vaccinated can still contract the virus and potentially develop other conditions, such as HIV, shingles, or herpes.\n\nSecondly, the vaccines may not be effective in people with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV or other immunodeficiencies. In these cases, the vaccines may not provide adequate protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and people may be more susceptible to other conditions.\n\nThirdly, the vaccines may not provide long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The study cited in the evidence states that 78% of deaths in the fully vaccinated group occurred in people with multiple other illnesses, not that 75% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in individuals who had at least four other illnesses or diseases.

While it's true that the exact number of polar bears is difficult to determine, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has reported that the global estimate of polar bears was 21,470 to 28,370 in 1993.

This means that there is no reliable data to support the claim of a 400% increase in polar bear population over the past 45 years.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that whales are nearly fully recovered is also misleading.

Governor Reynolds did not single-handedly secure the funding, but rather, she was one of the many governors who received funding as part of the plan.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that Governor Reynolds has made broadband expansion a state priority, and the Empower Rural Iowa Broadband Grant Program is part of her initiative to improve broadband access in rural Iowa. While the federal funding was a significant contribution, it was not the only source of funding for the program. The state of Iowa also provided its own funding for the program, which demonstrates Governor Reynolds' commitment to improving broadband access in the state.\n\nThirdly, the claim is misleading because it implies that Governor Reynolds is trying to take credit for the federal funding without acknowledging its true source. However, the evidence shows that Governor Reynolds' press release announcing the funding did mention the federal origin of",

Cindy Axne and signed into law by President Joe Biden\" is TRUE. The evidence presented shows that the funds were part of the American Rescue Plan, which was approved by Rep. Axne and signed into law by President Biden. Gov. Reynolds' press release failed to mention this crucial information, instead taking credit for the funding as if it were solely her initiative. This is a clear example of Gov. Reynolds attempting to take credit where credit is not due, and it is essential to hold her accountable for her actions. By acknowledging the true source of the funding, we can ensure transparency and honesty in government, and recognize the important role that Rep. Axne and President Biden played in securing these funds for Iowa.",

Cindy Axne and signed into law by President Joe Biden is FALSE.\n\nWhile it is true that the funds are part of the American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law by President Biden, it is also true that the Empower Rural Iowa Broadband Grant Program was established by Gov. Reynolds' executive order in 2018, and the state has provided some of its own funding for broadband improvements in rural Iowa.\n\nFurthermore, the grants announced by Gov. Reynolds are part of the state's efforts to reduce the amount of areas in Iowa unserved or underserved by broadband service, which is a priority for the state. While Rep. Axne did vote in favor of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which included funding for broadband expansion, it is unfair to suggest that Gov. Reynolds is taking credit for federal funds without acknowledging the state's own efforts and contributions to the program.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is FALSE because it misrepresents the nature of the funding and the role of Gov. Reynolds in the Empower Rural Iowa Broadband Grant Program. While the federal funds are an important part of the program, they are not the only source of funding, and Gov. Reynolds' efforts to expand broadband access in Iowa are a key part of the state's overall strategy.",

However, it is also partially false because the claim implies that Gov. Reynolds is solely responsible for the funding, which is not accurate. The state of Iowa also contributed its own funding to the program, and Gov. Reynolds has made broadband expansion a priority in her administration. Additionally, the claim ignores the role of Rep.

According to Youngkin, the Republican governor of Virginia, the state's educational standards for math and reading are now the lowest in the nation. This claim is supported by federal research, which shows that Virginia has the lowest baselines for student proficiency on its standardized tests of all measured states for fourth-grade math and reading and eighth-grade reading.\n\nIn 2019, 62% of Virginia fourth graders tested below proficiency in reading and 52% didn't reach the national standard on math. Among Virginia eighth graders, 67% were below proficiency in reading and 62% in math. These statistics demonstrate that Virginia's education standards are indeed lower than those of other states.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence shows that Virginia's standards for proficiency are not only lower but also less rigorous than those of other states. For instance, in fourth-grade reading, Virginia's proficiency standards were the lowest among 49 states, with an equivalent score of 200, while the median score among states was 224. Similarly, in fourth-grade math, Virginia's standards were the lowest among 49 states, with an equivalent score of 219, while the median score among states was 242.\n\nIn addition, the evidence highlights that Virginia's standards for proficiency are not aligned with the national standards.

In fact, the DMED data shows that the number of miscarriage codes has been steadily increasing since 2017, with a significant jump in 2020. This increase is likely due to changes in reporting and data collection methods, rather than a sudden spike in miscarriages.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's claim that there was an almost 300% increase in cancer diagnoses is also based on a flawed analysis of the data. The DMED data shows that the number of cancer diagnoses has been increasing over time, but the rate of increase is not as dramatic as the opponent claims. In fact, the DMED data shows that the",

Without a waiting period, we allow impulsive decisions to result in devastating consequences. This is precisely why a 48-hour waiting period is crucial in preventing crimes of passion and keeping our communities safe.\n\nResearch has consistently shown that waiting periods can reduce firearm homicides by 17% and states with waiting periods avoid around 750 homicides per year (According to the study). This is a significant reduction in gun violence, and it's a testament to the effectiveness of waiting periods in preventing impulsive decisions from resulting in harm.\n\nMoreover, experts have noted that waiting periods can help individuals cool off and reduce the likelihood of violent tendencies. As the researchers wrote, \"Given sufficient time to cool off, the types of intense negative emotions that lead to violent tendencies can pass.\" This suggests that inserting even a short delay in the gun-buying process has the potential to reduce gun violence without restricting anyone's right to own a gun.\n\nAdditionally, waiting periods can also prevent people from getting a gun in time to protect themselves. For instance, a waiting period for a woman being stalked or harassed could literally be deadly. This highlights the importance of considering the potential consequences of not having a waiting period in place.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly supports the",
    "con_opening": "I disagree with the claim that \"48-Hour waiting periods limit crimes of passion and keep our communities safe.\" While the claim suggests that waiting periods can prevent impulsive decisions and reduce gun violence, the evidence provided is mixed and does not support this claim.\n\nFirstly, the claim relies heavily on a single study that found a 17% reduction in firearm homicides in states with waiting periods. However, this study is not without its limitations. The study's authors themselves note that the results are \"mixed\" and that some studies have found no correlation between waiting periods and gun violence. Furthermore, the study's methodology is not without flaws, and its findings may not be generalizable to all populations.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the potential negative consequences of waiting periods.

The study's authors themselves note that the results are \"mixed\" and that some studies have found no correlation between waiting periods and gun violence.

    "pro_opening": "Good evening, esteemed debaters and audience. I'm here to present the opening argument in support of the claim that \"As compared to last year, Texas has about 15% more power generation capacity.\"\n\nFirstly, I'd like to highlight the statement made by Governor Greg Abbott himself, where he confidently stated that Texas has about 15% more power generation capacity compared to last year. This statement is not just a casual remark, but rather a fact-based assertion that is backed by data.\n\nAccording to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the available generation capacity has increased from 83,000 megawatts in winter 2020-21 to 85,000 megawatts in winter 2021-22, which represents a 2% increase. However, when we look at the total installed capacity, we see a more significant increase. According to ERCOT and PUC officials, the total installed capacity has increased from 102,874 megawatts in winter 2020 to 118,257 megawatts in winter 2021, which represents a 15% increase.\n\nThis increase in power generation capacity is not just due to the addition of new power plants, but also due to the growth of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Texas has become a leader in solar power, with the state producing more solar energy than any other state in the country. In 2022, Texas was the second-largest solar energy producer, after California",

While it is true that the total installed capacity has increased from 102,874 megawatts in winter 2020 to 118,257 megawatts in winter 2021, as stated by ERCOT and PUC officials, this increase is not necessarily a reflection of the actual power generation capacity available at any given time.\n\nThe evidence suggests that the added capacity includes wind and solar energy, which do not operate at 100% capacity all the time. As Doug Lewin, energy consultant and president of Stoic Energy Consulting, pointed out, \"There is no resource that has a 100% operational capacity... That does not exist, but generally thermal plants have a higher operational capacity.\" This means that the actual power generation capacity available at any given time is likely to be lower than the total installed capacity.\n\nFurthermore, the seasonal data from grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas indicates that available generation capacity is at 85,000 megawatts for winter 2021-22, up from 83,000 megawatts in winter 2020-21. This increase is only 2% compared to the 15% increase in total installed capacity. This suggests that the actual power generation capacity available at any given time has not increased as much as the total installed capacity.\n\nAdditionally, the state's average residential electricity rates have historically been higher than the U.S. average",

This increase in total installed capacity is a significant indicator of the state's ability to generate power and meet demand.\n\nMy opponent's argument that the added capacity includes wind and solar energy, which do not operate at 100% capacity all the time, is a valid point. However, this does not necessarily mean that the total installed capacity is not a relevant metric. The fact that wind and solar energy are intermittent sources of power does not diminish the importance of the total installed capacity.\n\nFurthermore, the seasonal data from grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas indicates that available generation capacity is at 85,000 megawatts for winter 2021-22, up from 83,000 megawatts in winter 2020-21.

    "con_rebuttal": "I'd like to respectfully disagree with my opponent's argument. While it's true that Texas has added some new power generation capacity, the claim that it has increased by 15% compared to last year is misleading.\n\nFirstly, the opponent's reliance on Governor Abbott's statement is problematic. As we know, politicians often make statements that are not entirely accurate or up-to-date. We should be cautious when relying on a single source, especially when it comes to complex data.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's use of ERCOT's data is also problematic. While it's true that the available generation capacity has increased from 83,000 megawatts to 85,000 megawatts, this represents a 2% increase, not 15%. This is a significant difference, and it's important to be accurate when presenting data.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument relies heavily on the growth of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. While it's true that Texas has made significant strides in this area, we must also consider the intermittency of these sources. As my opponent's own evidence states, the sun isn't always shining, and the wind isn't always blowing. This means that these sources are not always available to generate power, which reduces their overall capacity.\n\nFinally, the opponent's argument ignores the fact that the state's average residential electricity rates have historically been higher than the U.S. average.

Additionally, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and Public Utility Commission (PUC) officials have confirmed this increase, making it a reliable and trustworthy source.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that Texas has become a leader in solar power, with the state adding more solar energy capacity than any other state in the US, is a testament to the state's commitment to increasing its power generation capacity.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented overwhelmingly supports the claim that Texas has indeed increased its power generation capacity by 15% compared to last year.

The sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow. Additionally, the grid's ability to handle demand depends on various factors, including the location of conversions from natural gas to electricity and the overall efficiency of the grid.\n\nFurthermore, while the state has made significant strides in increasing its renewable energy capacity, it is important to note that the state's average residential electricity rates have historically been higher than the U.S. average.

The evidence does not support the claim that there is a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens who engaged in legitimate political discourse. The cases of political prisoners in Cuba and the United States are not comparable, as they are based on different circumstances and laws. The fact that some politicians have condemned the attack on the Capitol does not mean that there is a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens who engaged in legitimate political discourse.

As we begin, I'd like to highlight the evidence that supports this claim.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that the Federal Reserve is an independent central bank that has significant influence over monetary policy. The claim that Kennedy was planning to end the Federal Reserve has been circulating online and in a book, and we're here to investigate its validity.\n\nAccording to Nicholas F. Jacobs, an assistant professor of government at Colby College, Kennedy supported legislation in 1962 to reorganize the terms of the Federal Reserve, which would have taken effect in 1965. This proposal aimed to stagger the terms of the chair and vice chair, preventing a president from having undue influence over Fed leadership.\n\nFurthermore, Ira Stoll, the author of \"JFK, Conservative,\" has conducted extensive research on Kennedy's economic policies and found no evidence that Kennedy was planning to end the Federal Reserve. Stoll notes that Kennedy's assassination makes people speculate about what he would have done, but there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.\n\nAdditionally, the Congressional Research Service debunked common myths about the Federal Reserve in 1996, including the theory that Kennedy's desire to rein in the Federal Reserve led to his assassination.

This proposal was not an attempt to abolish the Federal Reserve, but rather to reorganize its leadership structure. The fact that the proposal would have taken effect after Kennedy's first term would have ended suggests that it was not an attempt to exert undue influence over the Federal Reserve.\n\nSecondly, the evidence from Ira Stoll, the author of a book about Kennedy's economic policies, states that he found no evidence that Kennedy was planning to end the Federal Reserve. Stoll's research suggests that Kennedy's assassination makes people theorize about what he would have done, but there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that he was planning to abolish the Federal Reserve.\n\nThirdly, the Congressional Research Service debunked common myths about the Federal Reserve, including the theory that Kennedy's purported desire to rein in the Federal Reserve somehow led to his assassination.

This decision sparked widespread outrage among donors, who felt that their contributions were being used to support an illegal and violent protest.\n\nIn response, supporters of the convoy began sharing posts on social media, encouraging donors to dispute their credit card charges and request a chargeback. This strategy was based on the understanding that GoFundMe would be forced to cover the chargeback fees, which could range from $25 to $40 per transaction.\n\nThe evidence suggests that this approach was not only a viable option but also a more effective way to hold GoFundMe accountable for its decision. As a Mastercard spokesperson explained, the purpose of a chargeback is to return a consumer's money when services were not rendered or products were not delivered as promised. In this case, GoFundMe failed to deliver on its promise to refund donations, and the chargeback process provided a mechanism for donors to reclaim their money.\n\nMoreover, the fact that GoFundMe ultimately changed its plans and decided to automatically refund all contributions directly, without requiring donors to submit a request, suggests that the chargeback strategy was an effective way to pressure the company into taking action",

By requesting a chargeback, donors would be going against the company's original plan to refund their contributions, which could lead to further complications and delays.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that GoFundMe has systems in place to defend against chargeback abuse. This means that the company is prepared to handle such requests and may not incur significant fees as a result. In fact, the Mastercard spokesperson explicitly stated that the purpose of a chargeback is to return a consumer's money when services were not rendered or products were not delivered as promised.

The claim that the Biden administration's Unaccompanied Alien Children process has \"no vetting, no transparency, and no consideration for child and public safety\" is FALSE.\n\nFirstly, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the unaccompanied children's program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which has been in place long before the Biden administration. This program is designed to address the growing number of migrant children arriving in the U.S. without a parent or legal guardian.\n\nSecondly, the Biden administration has implemented deportation priorities, which means that immigrants who arrive illegally have higher hurdles to clear before becoming citizens and voting. This is a necessary step to ensure public safety and national security.\n\nThirdly, the administration has taken steps to address the issue of unaccompanied minors, including setting up a task force to coordinate reunification of families and negotiating settlements with lawsuits filed on behalf of parents and children who were separated.\n\nFourthly, the claim that the administration has no transparency is unfounded. The administration has provided data on immigration encounters under Biden, and the available data shows that fewer people have come to the U.S. under Biden than under Trump.\n\nLastly, the claim that the administration has no consideration for child and public safety is also FALSE. The administration has taken steps to address the mental-health problems of children who were separated from their parents, including setting up a task force to coordinate reunification of families.\n\nIn conclusion,",

Additionally, the administration has set up a task force to coordinate reunification of families and has negotiated settlements with lawsuits filed on behalf of parents and children who were separated.

The American Rescue Plan, supply chain problems, and changes in spending patterns due to the pandemic have all played a significant role. Additionally, the war in Ukraine and global energy and commodity price increases have also contributed to the current inflationary environment.\n\nFurthermore, while the U.S. has a higher inflation rate than some of its peers, it's not the only country experiencing high inflation. Many other developed nations have also seen significant price increases.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has played a crucial role in this effort, collecting and analyzing data from millions of COVID-19 tests conducted across the United States.\n\nAccording to the evidence, the CDC receives a small percentage of COVID-19 samples from U.S. public health agencies, which are then tested for the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

This limited scope of data collection does not support the claim that the CDC has amassed the largest collection of human data in history.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that the CDC's data collection methods are not comprehensive, as they rely on voluntary reporting from states and local health departments.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that the U.S. produced an average of 12.2 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2020, and 11.3 million barrels per day in 2021.

This claim is supported by multiple sources, including a quote from Demertzis, who attributed the mayor's \"strong leadership\" to a downturn in crime.\n\nThe evidence also shows that the city's crime rate was at a low point when Mayor Irvin stepped down as mayor in 2009, which suggests that the crime rate was already declining before his tenure. However, the evidence also indicates that during his first year in office, homicides in Aurora did indeed decrease by 43%, which was rounded down to 40%.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that this decrease in homicides is not an isolated incident.

While it's true that the number of homicides in Aurora decreased, the claim is based on a flawed comparison and lacks context.\n\nFirstly, the claim relies on a single-year comparison, which is unreliable. As Gest, who oversees daily news digest Crime and Justice News, pointed out, it's unreliable to compare homicide rates from year-to-year, especially with small numbers like Aurora's. Any one event that results in multiple homicides can create a drastic change in the homicide rate.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that the city's crime rate was already at a low point when the mayor took office. According to the evidence, the city's crime rate was at a low point in 2009, which is the earliest comprehensive data available. This means that the decrease in homicides was likely a continuation of a trend that started before the mayor took office, rather than a result of their policies.\n\nThirdly, the claim lacks context about the overall crime rate in Aurora. While the number of homicides decreased, the evidence suggests that other types of crime, such as aggravated assaults and robberies, may have increased.

This claim is not a personal opinion but a statement backed by evidence and supported by various international organizations.\n\nOne of the primary pieces of evidence is the statement made by Putin himself, where he explicitly mentions the need to \"demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.\" This statement highlights the alleged persecution of ethnic Russians by the Ukrainian government, which is a crucial aspect of the genocide claim.\n\nFurthermore, the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe (OSCE) conducts special monitoring in Eastern Ukraine, representing 57 nations, including Russia. This organization has observed the situation on the ground and has reported on the human rights violations committed by both sides. While the OSCE has not explicitly stated that genocide is taking place, it has documented numerous instances of violence and human rights abuses, which supports the claim that ethnic Russians are facing persecution.\n\nAdditionally, Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of committing a massacre in a city outside of Kyiv, claiming they found hundreds of dead people after Russian forces withdrew from the area.

For example, PolitiFact rated Putin's claim of genocide as FALSE, citing a lack of evidence to support the claim.\n\nSecondly, the evidence presented does not show a widespread and systematic effort to exterminate ethnic Russians in Ukraine. While there have been reports of violence and human rights abuses, these are not systematic or widespread enough to constitute genocide. In fact, the UN Commission on Human Rights has reported a significant decrease in civilian deaths in Eastern Ukraine, which contradicts the claim of genocide.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the context of the conflict in Ukraine, which is a complex and multifaceted issue. The conflict is not simply a case of ethnic Russians being targeted by the Kyiv regime, but rather a complex conflict involving multiple parties and interests.\n\nFinally, the claim relies on misleading and cherry-picked evidence.

This is a verifiable fact, supported by multiple sources, including the project's original proposal and various news articles.\n\nSecondly, it's crucial to understand that the United States imports a significant amount of oil from Russia. According to the U.S. Energy Administration, in 2021, the U.S. imported approximately 672,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia. This accounts for around 8% of total U.S. oil imports and 3-4% of U.S. oil consumption.\n\nNow, let's compare these figures. If the Keystone XL pipeline had been completed, it would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day. This is more than the amount of oil the U.S. imports from Russia, which is approximately 672,000 barrels per day.

The evidence suggests that the pipeline would have carried up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day, but it does not guarantee that it would have produced that amount. In fact, the pipeline would have required years of construction and likely faced legal challenges, which would have made it uncertain whether it could have produced a net increase of that number of barrels per day.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that the pipeline would have been used to transport oil from Canada, which is already a significant supplier of oil to the U.S. market. The evidence suggests that Canada is already a major supplier of oil to the U.S., and the pipeline would have simply transported oil that is already being transported some other way.

Biden was speaking on the 22nd anniversary of 9/11, a solemn occasion that is often marked by reflection and remembrance. It's possible that his statement was an emotional expression of his commitment to the military and his experience in the region, rather than a literal count of the number of times he's traveled.\n\nFurthermore, while some may argue that Biden's statement is an exaggeration, it's important to consider the broader context of his military service and his role as a public figure.

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present the opening argument in support of the claim that \"Almost half of every dollar that we spend on gas, it goes to New York State.\"\n\nFirstly, let's establish the gas tax in New York State. According to Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, the gas tax in New York is about 50 cents per gallon. This is a crucial piece of information, as it sets the foundation for our calculation.\n\nAdditionally, we have evidence from the American Petroleum Institute, which Helming's office relied on, stating that the gas tax in New York is indeed around 50 cents per gallon. This further solidifies the accuracy of the claim.\n\nNow, let's consider the total taxes paid by a New Yorker filling up in a county where the local sales tax is 4 percent. According to the evidence, this would amount to a total of 67.75 cents in all taxes per gallon. This includes the state taxes, local sales tax, and federal excise tax.\n\nNow, let's do some simple math. If we assume an average gas price of $3.50 per gallon, and considering the total taxes paid, we can calculate that approximately 48.22 cents of every dollar spent on gas goes to New York State. This is a staggering amount, and it's clear that a significant portion of our gas money is indeed going to the state.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to note that this calculation does not take into",
    "con_opening": "I disagree with the claim that \"almost half of every dollar that we spend on gas, it goes to New York State.\" This claim is misleading and inaccurate.\n\nFirstly, the claim relies on a flawed understanding of how gas taxes work. The evidence states that New York's gas tax is set on a cents-per-gallon rate, not a percentage of the price per gallon. This means that the percentage of money that consumers pay to the state government for gas taxes falls when gas prices rise. This is a crucial point that the claim ignores.\n\nSecondly, the claim does not account for the federal excise tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, which is a fixed amount that is not dependent on the state's gas tax rate. This means that the total tax burden on consumers is higher than the state's gas tax alone.\n\nThirdly, the claim does not provide a clear breakdown of how the 50 cents per gallon gas tax in New York is distributed. It is unclear whether this amount includes local sales taxes, which vary by county, and other taxes. Without this information, it is impossible to accurately determine how much of every dollar spent on gas goes to New York State.\n\nFinally, the claim is misleading because it does not provide context about the overall tax burden on New Yorkers. The evidence suggests that New Yorkers pay a total of 67.75 cents in all taxes per gallon, which is a significant amount. However, this does not necessarily mean that almost half of every dollar",

In fact, the evidence suggests that the state's gas tax is set at a fixed rate of 50 cents per gallon, which means that the percentage of money that consumers pay to the state government for gas taxes remains constant regardless of the price of gas.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's argument that the claim does not account for the federal excise tax of 18.4 cents per gallon is irrelevant to the claim. The claim is specifically referring to the state's gas tax, not the federal excise tax. Additionally, the claim does not need to provide a breakdown of how the 50 cents per gallon gas tax is distributed, as the claim is simply stating that almost half of every dollar spent on gas goes to New York State. This is a straightforward and accurate statement.\n\nFinally, my opponent's argument that the claim is misleading because it does not provide context about the overall tax burden on New Yorkers is also unfounded.

While it's true that the gas tax is around 50 cents per gallon, this is not the only tax that is paid on gas. The opponent fails to account for the federal excise tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, which is a significant portion of the total taxes paid.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's calculation also ignores the fact that the state taxes are set on a cents-per-gallon rate, not a percentage of the price per gallon.

This is a crucial point that the opponent fails to consider.\n\nAdditionally, the opponent's calculation is based on an average gas price of $3.50 per gallon, which is not a realistic assumption. Gas prices can vary significantly depending on the location, and it's unfair to assume a fixed price.\n\nMoreover, the opponent's calculation does not take into account the local sales tax, which varies by county and can range from 3.5% to 4.5%.

This means that for every dollar spent on gas, 67.75 cents goes towards taxes, which is a significant portion. Additionally, the claim is not just limited to the gas tax, but also includes the loss of SALT deductibility, which has resulted in a financial hit to New Yorkers.

However, experts dispute this figure, and the actual impact of SALT deductibility on New York's tax revenue is unclear.\n\nIn conclusion, while New Yorkers do pay a significant amount in gas taxes, the claim that almost half of every dollar spent on gas goes to New York State is an exaggeration. A more accurate representation of the tax burden would be that around 67.75 cents of every dollar spent on gas goes towards taxes, not almost half. Therefore, I conclude that the claim is HALF-TRUE.",

    "pro_opening": "I'm excited to present my opening argument in support of the claim that the presence of apes calls into question the concept of evolution.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that humans and modern-day apes share a common ancestor that lived between 6-8 million years ago. This is a widely accepted fact among scientists, supported by genetic and fossil evidence. However, it's crucial to note that this common ancestor is not the same as the apes we see today. As apes evolved, they followed their own trajectories, and we did not develop the same characteristics as humans, such as walking upright.\n\nSecondly, it's a misconception to assume that every animal is evolving with the goal of becoming human or more human-like. Evolution is a natural process that occurs in response to environmental pressures, and species adapt to their surroundings in unique ways. The apes alive today are not striving to become humans; they are simply evolving to thrive in their respective environments.\n\nThirdly, the presence of apes today raises questions about the concept of evolution. If humans evolved from apes, why are there still apes? This is a valid question that challenges the idea of a linear progression from ape to human. It's not a straightforward process, and there are many uncertainties and complexities involved.\n\nFinally, it's important to recognize that the scientific community is constantly refining its understanding of evolution.

The evidence provided does not support this claim, and in fact, it reinforces the scientific consensus on human evolution.\n\nFirstly, the claim relies on a flawed understanding of evolution. Evolution is not a linear process where every animal is evolving towards becoming human or more human-like. As Jessica Thompson, an assistant professor of anthropology at Yale University, pointed out, evolution is a series of splits, where different species evolve independently. This means that apes and humans evolved differently over time, and it's not surprising that we see different species today.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the overwhelming genetic and fossil evidence that supports human evolution. Anthropologists have pinpointed the common ancestor of humans and modern-day apes to be between 6-8 million years ago. This is supported by genetic studies and fossil records, which show a clear pattern of evolutionary change over time.\n\nThirdly, the claim relies on a misunderstanding of the concept of evolution. Evolution is not a goal-oriented process where species are striving to become more complex or intelligent. It's a natural process that occurs through natural selection, genetic drift, and other mechanisms. The fact that apes and humans evolved differently does not mean that one is superior to the other.\n\nFinally, the claim is misleading because it implies that the presence of apes today is a problem for the theory of evolution.

The evidence is complex and open to interpretation, and there are many uncertainties and controversies in the field of paleoanthropology.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's claim that evolution is not a goal-oriented process is a misconception.

The evidence presented highlights the fact that humans and modern-day apes evolved from ancient apes, but the apes alive today are not the same kinds of apes that were alive millions of years ago. This is evident in their distinct characteristics, such as the apes' inability to walk upright like humans. Furthermore, the misconception that every animal is evolving with the goal of becoming human or more human-like is a misconception. The fact that apes have followed their own trajectories and did not develop the same characteristics as humans is a testament to the complexity and diversity of evolution.\n\nThe opposing side may argue that the concept of evolution is supported by scientific evidence, but I would counter that the evidence presented is limited and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary process. The fact that there are still apes today, despite the supposed evolution of humans, raises questions about the accuracy of the theory. Additionally, the idea that every animal is evolving towards a specific goal is a simplistic and reductionist view of evolution, and does not account for the vast diversity of species and their unique characteristics.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of apes today challenges the concept of evolution and highlights the need for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary process.

The fact that apes and humans have evolved differently over time is not a challenge to the concept of evolution, but rather a demonstration of its power and complexity.\n\nThe claim that apes are still present today because they are not evolving towards becoming human is a misconception. Evolution is not a linear process, and species do not have a predetermined goal or destination. Instead, evolution is a dynamic and ongoing process that has shaped the diversity of life on Earth.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of apes today is not a contradiction to the theory of evolution, but rather a testament to the fact that evolution is still occurring. The fact that apes have evolved differently from humans is a result of their unique evolutionary history and the selective pressures they have faced.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the presence of apes calls into question the concept of evolution is FALSE.

As stated by Miller, \"Gas prices have skyrocketed since Joe Biden took office and continue to do so every day.\" This is a verifiable fact that cannot be disputed.\n\nNow, some may argue that the recent increases in U.S. gas prices are due to a lack of oil production, rather than any actions taken by Biden. However, this argument is flawed. Experts have repeatedly said that the recent increases in U.S. gas prices are due mainly to a lack of oil production, much more than any actions taken by Biden, such as canceling the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nFurthermore, some may claim that the U.S. government is driving up petroleum prices to push people toward electric cars, and that increasing dependence on renewable energy sources like solar and wind power will eventually spark an energy crisis.

This is evident in the evidence provided, where experts say that the recent increases in U.S. gas prices are due mainly to a lack of oil production, much more than any actions taken by Biden, such as canceling the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that the demand for oil has increased due to the recovery of the U.S. economy, which has led to higher gas prices. As the economy began to recover during the second half of 2020, it increased demand for oil, which in turn pushed up gas prices.\n\nThirdly, inflation is another major factor contributing to the rise in gas prices.

While it is true that there are multiple factors contributing to the rise in gas prices, including a lack of oil production, increased demand, and inflation, I believe that the Biden administration's policies have also played a significant role in driving up gas prices.\n\nFirstly, the evidence suggests that the Biden administration's decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline has had a significant impact on oil production in the United States. The pipeline was a major project that would have increased oil production and reduced reliance on foreign oil. By canceling the project, the Biden administration has reduced the amount of oil available in the market, leading to higher prices.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that the Biden administration's policies have also led to increased demand for oil. The administration's efforts to promote electric vehicles and reduce carbon emissions have led to increased demand for oil, which has driven up prices.\n\nThirdly, the evidence suggests that the Biden administration's policies have also led to increased inflation. The administration's decision to increase the minimum wage and implement other policies aimed at reducing income inequality have led to increased costs for businesses, which have been passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, including higher gas prices.\n\nFinally, the evidence suggests that the Biden administration's policies have also led to increased taxes on oil companies, which have reduced their ability to invest in new projects and increase",

As the evidence provided by Occupy Democrats shows, gas prices have increased and decreased throughout various administrations, with little correlation to the president or party in power. This suggests that the price of gasoline is determined by the state of the economy and the balance of supply and demand, rather than presidential policies.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's claim that the lack of oil production is the primary cause of high gas prices is misleading. While it's true that the U.S. has seen a decline in oil production, this is largely due to the natural decline of existing wells and the shift towards more efficient and sustainable energy sources.

    "pro_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position on the claim that Judge Jackson doesn't think perverts should have to register as sex offenders, saying it \"stigmatizes\" them.\n\nThroughout the debate, we've seen evidence that Judge Jackson has indeed questioned the effectiveness and constitutionality of sex offender registries. Her Harvard Law article examined the intent behind these registries, arguing that if the sole purpose is to \"make an example\" out of the offender, it would be punitive and violate the Constitution. This suggests that Judge Jackson believes the registry system is flawed and may not be an effective means of preventing recidivism.\n\nMoreover, during her Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Sen. Ted Cruz referenced her article and stated that Judge Jackson argued that civil commitment for sexual predators is unconstitutional. This implies that she has concerns about the treatment of sex offenders and may not support the current system.\n\nIt's also important to note that Judge Jackson's article was published during a time when sex offender registration and notification systems were still relatively new and varied by state. This context suggests that her views on the registry system may have been shaped by the evolving nature of these laws and the potential for unintended consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented supports the claim that Judge Jackson doesn't think perverts should have to register as sex offenders, citing concerns about the stigmatization of these individuals. Her academic work and public statements demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the registry system and its potential flaws, which may lead her to question its effectiveness and constitution",

While Judge Jackson did write an article questioning the constitutionality of sex offender registration, her argument was based on the intent behind the registry, not a blanket statement that sex offenders shouldn't register.\n\nIn fact, Judge Jackson's article examined the issue of sex offender registration in the context of the Constitution and the intent of the registry. She argued that if the sole objective of the registry was to \"make an example\" out of the offender, it would be punitive and therefore unconstitutional. However, she did not suggest that sex offenders shouldn't register at all.\n\nFurthermore, Judge Jackson's article was written in the context of a specific case, Wiggins v. Smith, where she was examining the constitutionality of a sex offender registration requirement. She concluded that the requirement was constitutional because it was designed to prevent future crimes, not simply to punish the offender.\n\nIn addition, Judge Jackson's article was written in 1996, and the sex offender registration laws have since been updated and expanded. It's unfair to take a statement from an article written decades ago and apply it to the current context without considering the evolution of the laws and the context in which they were written.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Judge Jackson doesn't think perverts should have to register as sex offenders because it \"stigmatizes\" them is FALSE.",

While Judge Jackson has questioned the constitutionality of sex offender registration, her arguments are based on the intent behind the registry, not a blanket statement that sex offenders shouldn't register.

The pamphlet discusses racial and social privilege, which is a collection of ideas that explain why racial inequality and disparities persist despite civil rights laws and court rulings.\n\nThirdly, the fact that the pamphlet was used in Home Depot's Canadian division, albeit not as part of required programming, suggests that the company is at least acknowledging the importance of addressing privilege and promoting diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence suggests that the photo shows a real Home Depot worksheet on \"privilege\" used to train its employees, or at the very least, used as a resource in their Canadian division.

According to Voice of America, Title 42 stems from a 1944 public health law aimed at preventing the spread of communicable diseases. This law has been in place for decades, and it's crucial to maintain it to protect our country from a surge of illegal immigration.\n\nSecondly, there is evidence to suggest that most Americans support keeping Title 42 in place. Senator Tillis, in a press release, stated, \"Most Americans favor keeping Title 42 in place, so I hope we can agree that we should maintain this policy and protect our country from a surge of illegal immigration over the next few months.\" This statement is supported by polling data, which shows that a significant majority of Americans support keeping Title 42 in place.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. is the largest donor to family planning and reproductive health programs worldwide, and Title 42 plays a crucial role in preventing the spread of communicable diseases. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the U.S. is the largest purchaser and distributor of contraceptives internationally. This demonstrates the importance of Title 42 in maintaining public health and preventing the spread of diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence presented, it's clear that most Americans favor keeping Title 42 in place.

As polling experts noted, the question did not ask voters if they were familiar with the policy, making it difficult to assess their knowledge or support for it. This lack of clarity can lead to inaccurate results.\n\nSecondly, the poll's findings are not representative of the entire American population. The poll only surveyed a small sample of people, and the results may not be generalizable to the broader population. Additionally, the poll did not provide information on the demographics of the respondents, making it difficult to determine if the results are representative of different groups within the population.\n\nThirdly, the claim relies on a single poll, which is not a reliable source of information.

You then buy $67 worth of fuel and in doing so pay a 48% fuel tax (fuel tax = $32.16 + $6.70 GST). This means that the government just got $71.86 tax from your hard earned $100.\"\n\nFirstly, let's establish the facts. According to the evidence, if you earn $100 and pay $33 income tax, you are left with $67. This is a straightforward calculation.\n\nNext, let's examine the fuel tax. The evidence states that the fuel tax is 48% of the total purchase, which is $67. This means that the fuel tax is $32.16 + $6.70 GST, which adds up to $38.86. This is a significant portion of the total purchase price.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total taxes paid. The income tax is $33, and the fuel tax is $38.86. This adds up to a total of $71.86. This is the amount of tax paid by the individual.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is TRUE. The government receives a total of $71.86 in taxes from the individual's hard-earned $100.

    "con_opening": "I disagree with the claim that the government gets $71.86 tax from your hard-earned $100. The claim is misleading because it does not accurately account for the actual fuel tax rates and GST in Australia. According to the evidence, the fuel excise tax rate is 22.1 cents per liter, not 44.2 cents per liter as claimed. Additionally, the GST is 10%, not 48%. \n\nUsing the correct figures, we can calculate the total taxes paid on a $67 gas purchase. The fuel excise tax would be $6.85 (22.1 cents per liter x 31 liters), and the GST would be $6.70. This totals $13.55, not $32.16. Therefore, the government would receive $13.55 in taxes, not $71.86.\n\nFurthermore, the claim does not consider the income tax rate, which varies depending on income level. The evidence shows that income tax rates range from 10% to 22%, and some individuals may not pay income tax at all. The claim's assumption that the entire $100 is subject to a 33% income tax rate is inaccurate.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is misleading and inaccurate.

This is a correct calculation of the income tax rate, which is 33%. The opponent's argument that the income tax rate varies depending on income level is irrelevant to this calculation, as the claim is specifically stating that the individual earns $100 and pays $33 income tax.\n\nThe claim then states that the individual buys $67 worth of fuel and pays a 48% fuel tax.

The opponent's argument is incorrect and misleading, and the claim is accurate.\n\nIn addition, the claim is not misleading because it is a specific example of a scenario, and it is not making a general statement about the entire tax system.

And this is really an impressive place with a lot of impressive students.\" This statement is a direct quote from the former Vice President, and it's hard to dispute his own words.\n\nSecondly, Biden has also mentioned that he taught political theory during his time at the University of Pennsylvania, which further supports the claim that he was a full professor. He said, \"I taught at the University of Pennsylvania for four years, and I used to teach political theory. And, folks, you always hear every generation has to fight for democracy.\"\n\nThirdly, the University of Pennsylvania itself has a faculty handbook that describes the rank of practice professor, which is the category that Biden held during his time at the university. According to the handbook, the rank of practice professor is \"confined to a small number of untenured full-time professorships\" in certain schools at Penn that permit the addition to the faculty of \"distinguished, highly experienced individuals who have achieved success in their fields and whose skills and knowledge are essential to the educational process at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.\" This suggests that",

According to the University's faculty handbook, this position is confined to a small number of untenured full-time professorships, and is intended for distinguished individuals who have achieved success in their fields.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that Biden's tenure in this position was closer to two years, not four, and his duties were limited to speaking events, not typical classroom teaching. This is a significant departure from the typical responsibilities associated with a full professorship, which includes teaching semester-long classes, conducting independent research, and handling administrative responsibilities.\n\nIn his statements, Biden has also been inconsistent and misleading about his time at the University of Pennsylvania. He has claimed to have taught political theory, but there is no evidence to support this claim. Additionally, his statements have been vague and unclear about the nature of his position and his responsibilities during his time at the university.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Joe Biden was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania for four years is FALSE.

In fact, the University of Pennsylvania's faculty handbook explicitly states that the rank of practice professor is confined to a small number of untenured full-time professorships.

However, this is not the only definition of a full professor. A full professor can also be someone who is recognized as an expert in their field and is brought in to share their knowledge and expertise with students. Biden's position as Professor of the Practice allowed him to do just that, and his duties may have included speaking events, which are an important part of the educational process.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's claim that Biden's tenure was shorter than four years is also misleading.

Additionally, his duties as a professor of the practice likely involved speaking events, which is a common activity for professors in this role.\n\nIt is also important to note that Biden's claim is not entirely inaccurate, as he did serve in this role for about two years, which is a significant amount of time.

Additionally, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has publicly stated that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than $175 billion in U.S. aid earmarked for Ukraine's war against Russia, which contradicts the claim that he has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is also inconsistent with publicly available information about Ukraine's military aid and spending. The Special Inspector General for Operation Atlantic Resolve has reported that not all of the money dedicated for Ukraine has been spent yet, and Zelenskyy's statements appear to be discussing the funding the country has received to date.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that \"The President of Ukraine owns a $",

According to the ATAGI advice, vaccines may be administered opportunistically while patients are undergoing sedation for unrelated procedures. This means that patients who are already under sedation for a different medical procedure can receive the COVID-19 vaccine without necessarily giving explicit consent.\n\nIt's crucial to note that this advice is not about forcing compliance with vaccination requirements. Rather, it's a way to increase vaccination rates among patients who may not have access to healthcare services or may be hesitant to receive the vaccine otherwise. By providing the vaccine during sedation, healthcare providers can ensure that these patients receive the necessary protection against COVID-19.\n\nMoreover, the claim that this advice is being used to force compliance is unfounded. Patient consent is still required, and healthcare providers must obtain informed consent from patients before administering the vaccine.

The evidence suggests that House Republicans have proposed a plan to cut Social Security and Medicare, which would have a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans, including those in Wisconsin.\n\nOne of the key pieces of evidence is the Republican Study Committee's plan, which proposes to sunset Social Security and Medicare in five years. This plan has been widely reported and has sparked concerns among seniors and advocates for these programs.\n\nFurthermore, there are quotes from prominent Republican politicians that support the claim. For instance, Rep. Jim Renacci has proposed a plan to end Medicare, which would put the healthcare of thousands of seniors in his district at risk. Similarly, Senate Republicans have proposed a plan to end Medicare, which would have devastating consequences for millions of Americans.\n\nIt's also important to note that the claim is not just about the Republican Study Committee's plan. There are other proposals and votes that have been taken by Republican politicians that support the claim. For example, Rep. Paul Ryan has proposed cutting federal spending, which would have a significant impact on Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence suggests that Republican politicians are pushing a plan that could raise taxes on almost one in three Wisconsinites and sunset",
    "con_opening": "I disagree with the claim that Republican politicians are pushing a plan \"that could raise taxes on almost one in three Wisconsinites and sunset Social Security and Medicare in five years.\" This claim is FALSE and misleading.\n\nFirstly, the evidence provided does not support the claim that Republicans are pushing a plan to sunset Social Security and Medicare in five years. The evidence only mentions a proposal from one faction within the House Republican Conference, which is not a binding plan and may not even pass. Additionally, the proposal does not specifically say that Medicare and Social Security would be phased out, but rather refers to \"federal legislation\" which is a vague term.\n\nSecondly, the claim that the plan would raise taxes on almost one in three Wisconsinites is also misleading. The evidence provided does not provide any concrete evidence to support this claim. In fact, the evidence suggests that the proposal is uncertain and may not even raise taxes at all. Economic experts have stated that any changes to the tax code would require congressional approval and are not certain.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is also misleading because it creates a false narrative that Republicans are trying to harm seniors and working families. The evidence provided does not support this claim and instead suggests that the proposal is part of a larger effort to reform the tax code and reduce government spending.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Republican politicians are pushing a plan \"that could raise taxes on almost one in three Wisconsinites and sunset Social Security and Medicare in five years\" is FALSE",

Jim Renacci's plan to end Medicare, and quotes from Republican leaders, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who have expressed support for reducing government spending and reforming entitlement programs.\n\nSecondly, the claim that the plan would raise taxes on almost one in three Wisconsinites is not misleading. The evidence provided suggests that the plan would reduce the tax deductions and loopholes that benefit the wealthy and large corporations, which would result in a tax increase for many Wisconsinites. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the plan would also reduce government spending on programs such as Social Security and Medicare, which would also result in a tax increase for many Wisconsinites.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is not creating a false narrative that Republicans are trying to harm seniors and working families. The evidence provided suggests that the plan is part of a larger effort to reform the tax code and reduce government spending, which would benefit the economy and create jobs. The plan is not intended to harm seniors and working families, but rather to make the tax code more fair and efficient.\n\nIn conclusion,",

While it is true that some Republican politicians have proposed changes to these programs, the claim is exaggerated and misleading.\n\nFirstly, the Republican Study Committee's plan is not a binding proposal, and it is uncertain whether it will be adopted. Additionally, the plan does not specifically propose to sunset Social Security and Medicare, but rather to reform them. This is a crucial distinction, as reforming these programs does not necessarily mean ending them.\n\nSecondly, the quotes from Republican politicians cited by the opponent are taken out of context. For example, Rep. Jim Renacci's proposal to end Medicare is not a plan to sunset the program, but rather a proposal to reform it. Similarly, Senate Republicans' proposal to end Medicare is not a plan to sunset the program, but rather a proposal to reform it.\n\nThirdly, the opponent's argument relies heavily on cherry-picked evidence and ignores the broader context. For example, the opponent cites a proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan to cut federal spending, but fails to mention that this proposal was part of a comprehensive budget plan that aimed to reduce the national debt and reform entitlement programs.\n\nFinally, the opponent's argument is based on a flawed assumption that raising taxes on almost one in three Wisconsinites is a necessary and sufficient condition for the claim to be true.

The potential impact on Wisconsin seniors and working families is significant, and it is crucial that we hold our elected officials accountable for their actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is not an exaggeration or a scare tactic, but a factual representation of the proposals being pushed by some Republican politicians.

The Republican Study Committee's plan, which has been cited as a source of this claim, does not propose phasing out Social Security and Medicare, but rather reducing the growth of these programs.\n\nAdditionally, the claim relies on a misleading interpretation of the Republican plan, which has been fact-checked by PolitiFact as Mostly False.

While Tennessee did pass a law restricting access to certain medications, including abortion pills, it did not specifically ban Plan B, the emergency contraceptive. According to the evidence, the law signed by Governor Bill Lee on May 5 does not address or ban emergency contraceptives like Plan B.\n\nSecondly, the law does impose strict restrictions on the dispensing of abortion pills, and it includes a $50,000 penalty for doctors or anyone who dispenses abortion pills by mail. However, there is no criminal penalty for patients who seek or obtain these medications.\n\nThirdly, while the law does not directly ban Plan B, it does raise concerns about the potential impact on emergency contraception. As stated in the evidence, if a fertilized egg is treated as a person, emergency contraception could potentially be banned.

The law's language also allows for the FDA to reclassify emergency contraceptives as abortifacients, which could lead to further restrictions on access to these medications.\n\nIn addition, the law's penalties for healthcare providers and pharmacies are severe, with fines of up to $50,000 for those who dispense abortion pills.

In fact, the statement from Sen.

    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that David Perdue voted with liberals for $10 trillion in new debt and his out-of-control federal spending is driving inflation through the roof is partially supported by the evidence. While it is true that the national debt did rise by about $10 trillion during Perdue's tenure as a one-term U.S. senator, from 2015 to 2021, it is important to note that this was a bipartisan effort, not solely the work of \"liberals.\" Additionally, much of the accumulated debt every year isn't even voted on; it essentially adds up from spending that's on autopilot, such as automatic borrowing for Medicare and Medicaid. Furthermore, inflation has multiple causes, and some experts point to spending approved after Perdue left office as a key cause. However, it is also true that Perdue did vote for significant spending measures during his tenure, which contributed to the national debt. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The claim states that Democrats had not spoken out against the violence, and I argue that this is indeed the case. The evidence suggests that there was a lack of condemnation from prominent Democrats, including party leaders and officials.\n\nFor instance, the article mentions that the Democratic Party of Virginia issued a statement on Twitter, saying neither the party nor its \"coordinated partners and affiliates\" had anything to do with the demonstration. This lack of condemnation is a clear indication that Democrats were not speaking out against the violence.\n\nFurthermore, the article highlights that some Democrats, such as Gov. Tony Evers, did issue statements condemning violence, but these statements were not specifically directed at the anti-abortion group or the activists involved in the fire and vandalism.

In fact, it shows that many Democrats, including Governor Tony Evers, condemned the violence and rejected it as a means of achieving political goals. Evers' statement on Twitter on May 8, 2022, explicitly stated: \"We reject violence against any person for disagreeing with another's view. Violence is not the way forward. Hurting others is never the answer.

However, the evidence shows that many Democrats have spoken out against the violence and have condemned it. This is not a matter of \"not speaking out\" but rather a matter of timing. The claim is trying to create a false narrative that Democrats are somehow complicit in the violence or are not taking it seriously.\n\nFinally, the claim is also misleading because it tries to create a false equivalence between the actions of the anti-abortion group and the actions of the Democrats.

The statement was issued at 12:13 p.m. on May 8, 2022, which is several hours after the incident occurred. This raises questions about whether the statement was a timely condemnation of the violence.\n\nSecondly, while some Democrats may have spoken out against the violence, the evidence suggests that many others did not. The list provided by Johnson's office includes a number of Democrats who have not condemned the violence, including national figures and some from Wisconsin. This suggests that there is a lack of unity among Democrats in condemning the violence.\n\nFinally, the claim is not trying to create a false narrative that Democrats are complicit in the violence or are not taking it seriously.

While some may argue that homemade baby formula recipes are not a viable option, I believe that with proper guidance and caution, they can be a temporary solution.\n\nOne crucial point to consider is that homemade formulas can be made using readily available ingredients, such as evaporated milk and Karo syrup, as shown in a 1960 recipe. This recipe has been shared online, and while it may not be perfect, it can serve as a starting point for parents who are struggling to find formula.\n\nMoreover, some experts argue that homemade formulas can be a viable option when done correctly. For instance, a recipe that uses cow's milk, whey, and a variety of oils has been shared online, claiming that homemade formula can be a \"viable option when you do it correctly.\" While this may not be a foolproof solution, it highlights the potential for innovation and adaptation in the face of a shortage.\n\nIt's also important to note that commercial infant formulas are not always perfect, and some may contain ingredients that are not suitable for all babies.

This is a clear indication that homemade formula is not a viable option.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights the potential risks of homemade formula, including contamination, inadequate amounts of critical nutrients, and excessive amounts of certain nutrients, such as salt, which can be harmful to infants' kidneys and livers.

In fact, the FDA's own guidelines for making homemade formula are vague and do not provide any specific guidance on how to ensure the safety and nutritional adequacy of homemade formula.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument that homemade formula is not a viable option because of the potential risks of contamination and inadequate nutrients is unfounded.

This article has been fact-checked and found to be false.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Gyorgy never tweeted comments linking pedophilia and Islam is supported by the evidence presented.

The tweet in question was fabricated, and the account it was attributed to does not belong to Reka Gyorgy. Furthermore, the article linked in the tweet has no connection to the former President Obama, and the author of the article has been fact-checked and found to have made false claims.\n\nAdditionally, we've seen that the claim relies on unverified and unreliable sources, including a Facebook post that has been labeled as \"missing context\" and a tweet that has been fact-checked as false. The author of the original tweet has even admitted that their claim was based on \"super-sloppy googling.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Reka Gyorgy tweeted comments linking pedophilia and Islam is a fabrication with no basis in reality.

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present the opening argument in support of the claim that agriculture is still the No. 1 sector of the economy in Georgia.\n\nFirstly, let's look at the evidence provided. According to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis, agriculture accounts for about 0.7% of Georgia's gross domestic product. While this percentage may seem small, it's essential to consider the overall size of the state's economy. Agriculture is still a significant contributor, with a value of around $74 billion to $75 billion, as stated by the Georgia Agriculture Secretary.\n\nMoreover, Georgia is a leading producer of various agricultural products, including peanuts, pecans, and broilers (chickens). In 2021, Georgia agriculture was a $4.6 billion industry, which is not a negligible amount. Additionally, the state ranks 17th among the 50 states in total farm receipts, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nIt's also important to note that agriculture has seen significant growth over the years. According to the Agriculture Department, production of food and other agricultural products nearly tripled between 1948 and 2017. This growth is attributed to innovations in animal and crop genetics, chemicals, equipment, and farm organization.\n\nWhile other sectors, such as finance, insurance, and real estate, may have a larger share of the state's economy, agriculture remains a vital part of Georgia's economy.

This is followed by professional and business services, manufacturing, and information services, which all account for a larger percentage of the economy than agriculture.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that agriculture is not even the second-largest sector of the economy in Georgia.

The claim that public health agencies are hiding fake COVID-19 variants or passing off the flu as COVID-19 is a baseless conspiracy theory with no scientific evidence to support it.\n\nMoreover, the claim that shingles will be passed off as monkeypox cases is also unfounded. There is no credible evidence to suggest that public health officials are planning to misdiagnose or misattribute shingles cases to monkeypox. In fact, medical experts have repeatedly emphasized the importance of accurate diagnosis and testing to ensure that patients receive the appropriate treatment and care.\n\nFurthermore, the claim relies on a flawed understanding of how vaccines work and the scientific process. Vaccines are rigorously tested and regulated to ensure their safety and efficacy, and any adverse events reported are thoroughly investigated to determine their cause.

    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim that \"they passed the flu off as COVID-19, and 'they're going to do the same thing with monkeypox and shingles'\" is largely based on anecdotal evidence and misinformation. While there have been instances of misdiagnosis and misinformation about COVID-19, there is no credible evidence to support the claim that public health agencies are intentionally misdiagnosing or mislabeling diseases. The claim relies on conspiracy theories and flawed understandings of how vaccines work and the scientific process. Medical experts have repeatedly warned against spreading misinformation about vaccines and have emphasized the importance of accurate diagnosis and testing. The claim is not supported by credible sources and is likely to undermine public trust in vaccines and public health agencies."

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present the opening argument in support of the claim that the N.C. GOP came out in support of Sen. Rick Scott's extremist policy to 'Rescue America.'\n\nFirstly, it's essential to note that Sen. Rick Scott, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, released an 11-point plan to \"Rescue America\" on February 22. This plan outlines his vision for a better America, which includes conservative goals such as local control of education, election integrity, religious liberty, and an improved healthcare system.\n\nNow, let's look at the evidence. According to the article, a North Carolina congressional candidate, Brown, stated that he \"admires\" Sen. Scott's attempt to create a roadmap for a better America. This suggests that at least one prominent figure within the North Carolina Republican Party has expressed support for Sen. Scott's plan.\n\nFurthermore, the article quotes Brown as saying, \"I think I appreciate that he is trying to look forward, he is trying to cast a positive vision... What Rick Scott has done, attempting to create a roadmap for a better America, is something that I admire as well.\" This quote indicates that Brown, a representative of the North Carolina Republican Party, has publicly endorsed Sen. Scott's plan.\n\nAdditionally, the article mentions that the North Carolina Republican Party has not regularly promoted or endorsed bills proposed at the federal level, especially those introduced by lawmakers from other states.

In fact, the tweet that sparked this claim was not made by the official North Carolina Republican Party organization, but rather by a North Carolina congressional candidate.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the North Carolina Republican Party has not taken a stance on Sen. Scott's \"Rescue America\" plan. The quote from Sen. Scott's colleague, Brown, expresses admiration for Scott's attempt to create a roadmap for a better America, but this does not constitute an endorsement of the plan by the North Carolina Republican Party.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence highlights that the plan has been rebuked by GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, which further undermines the claim that the N.C. GOP supports the plan. The fact that the plan would sunset Medicaid unless it was specifically renewed is also a significant concern, and it's unclear how the North Carolina Republican Party would address this issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the N.C.

A 2014 column by Oz and his colleague noted that 79% of the population favors universal background checks for gun buyers. This finding is echoed by other polls, including one that found 92% of Democrats and 70% of Republicans support background checks for private gun sales, with overall support at 81%.\n\nMoreover, polling expert Steven Smith at Washington University in St. Louis has stated that \"90% \u2014 or nearly 90% \u2014 support for background checks is a common finding in nationwide surveys.\" This suggests that the claim is not an outlier, but rather a consistent trend across various polls.\n\nFurthermore, a recent poll asked Americans about requiring \"criminal and mental background checks\" for all gun buyers and found that 72% overall either strongly or somewhat favored this measure, with 83% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans holding that view.

The 11% difference is not a significant enough gap to dismiss the overall trend of strong support for background checks.

The evidence presented shows that the U.S. has allocated a significant amount of money to Ukraine, with a total of $53 billion spent or allocated for military and humanitarian aid.\n\nThe claim is not about the effectiveness of the aid or the intentions behind it, but rather about the sheer amount of money being spent. The evidence shows that the U.S. could pay for 5 SWAT members $80,000 each and have them at every school front door, with almost $5,000 left over. This is a staggering amount of money that could be used to improve school security in the United States.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence presented highlights the fact that the U.S. has spent billions of dollars on school security equipment and services, with an estimated $2.7 billion spent in 2017 alone. This shows that the U.S. is already investing heavily in school security, and the additional $53 billion spent in Ukraine aid could be used to further enhance school safety.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the $53 billion spent in Ukraine aid could pay for 5 SWAT members $80,000 each and have them at every school front door is a factual statement that is supported by the evidence presented.

The claim that the $53 billion spent in Ukraine aid could pay for 5 SWAT members $80,000 each and have them at every school front door is FALSE.\n\nFirstly, the claim is based on a misleading calculation that ignores the fact that not all of the $53 billion has been spent yet. The Special Inspector General for Operation Atlantic Resolve has stated that the funding is being spent as intended, on US weapons manufacturing, non-military support in Ukraine, and support elsewhere in the region.\n\nSecondly, the claim is also based on a flawed assumption that the entire $53 billion is dedicated solely to Ukraine's military aid. In reality, the breakdown shows that about $100 billion worth of aid is being sent to Ukraine, but the rest is funding US activities associated with the war and other countries in the region.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the fact that the US has provided more financial, humanitarian, and military support to Ukraine than any other nation since the outbreak of war. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy's Ukraine Support Tracker shows that the US has provided $8.2 billion in aid, far surpassing the total for all European Union countries combined.\n\nLastly, the claim is also based on a false narrative that the US is not caring about the safety of its own citizens.

Additionally, the claim assumes that the entire $53 billion could be redirected towards school security, which is not a realistic or accurate assumption. The evidence presented shows that the US has already spent billions of dollars on school security equipment and services, and that the additional $53 billion would not be necessary to achieve the goal of having SWAT members at every school front door."

The event was conducted by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, and it's evident that the drill was a routine exercise to prepare students and staff for potential emergency situations.\n\nNow, some may argue that the drill was simply a coincidence, but I'd like to highlight that the timing of the drill is suspicious. The drill took place just two months before the elementary school shooting, which raises questions about the purpose of the drill. Was it merely a coincidence, or was it a way to prepare for the actual event?\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the drill was conducted at the high school, while the elementary school shooting occurred at a different location, raises more red flags.

The drill was conducted in March, and the elementary school shooting occurred in May. There is no logical reason to assume that the drill was a precursor to the shooting or that it was staged to create a false narrative.\n\nSecondly, the drill was a standard active shooter training exercise, which is a common practice in many schools across the United States.

While a majority of the Senate did vote in favor of the Grassley-Cruz amendment, it's crucial to understand the context and the procedural nuances involved.\n\nAccording to the evidence, the Grassley-Cruz amendment received a majority vote, but it fell short of the 60 votes required to overcome the Democratic filibuster.

In reality, there have been many instances where unemployment has been below 4% and inflation has been above 4%, but the recession did not follow.

According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data, the number of Venezuelan immigrants at the southern border dropped from nearly 34,000 times, a rate of about 1,100 a day, to nearly 7,000, or about 230 a day, in November. This significant decrease in the number of Venezuelans attempting to enter the U.S. illegally is a clear indication that the new immigration program has been effective in reducing the flow of illegal immigration from Venezuela.\n\nSecondly, the program itself is designed to provide a legal pathway for Venezuelans to enter the U.S. It allows individuals to legally enter, live, and work in the U.S. for two years, as long as they have a U.S. sponsor and meet certain requirements. This legal pathway has likely reduced the incentive for Venezuelans to attempt to enter the U.S. illegally, as they can now do so in a safe and legal manner.\n\nThirdly, experts have confirmed that the number of Venezuelans attempting to enter the U.S. illegally has indeed decreased significantly since the implementation of the program.

As Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, stated, \"it's nearly impossible to tell which had the greater effect\" between the parole program and the use of Title 42. This means that we cannot attribute the decrease in Venezuelan immigration solely to the new program.\n\nSecondly, the evidence also suggests that the decrease in Venezuelan immigration may be due to other factors, such as the fact that Mexico has begun accepting a limited number of deported Venezuelans, which has reduced the number of Venezuelans attempting to enter the U.S. illegally.

This policy allows the U.S. to expel migrants back to their country of origin, which has been a major factor in the decline of Venezuelan migration.\n\nSecondly, the diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Venezuela have been strained, making it difficult for the U.S. to deport Venezuelans back to their country.

According to the evidence, Social Security is a government program that provides financial support to retirees, disabled individuals, and survivors of deceased workers. This means that Social Security operates independently of the federal budget and does not contribute to the deficit or national debt.\n\nThe article highlights that when Social Security draws down its assets to pay benefits to baby boomer retirees, it contributes to the unified budget deficit. However, this is a misleading statement. The unified budget deficit refers to the total deficit of the federal government, which includes all government programs, including Social Security. The fact that Social Security contributes to the unified budget deficit does not mean it contributes to the national debt.\n\nIn fact, the evidence suggests that Social Security has actually run surpluses in the past. From 1984 to 2009, Social Security collected more money in payroll taxes than it paid out in benefits, generating a surplus. This surplus was transferred from the Social Security program to the federal government's general fund. This means that Social Security has historically been a source of revenue for the federal government, rather than a contributor to the deficit.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to note that the national debt is the accumulation of all past deficits, minus any past surpluses.

This is supported by experts such as Andrew Biggs, who stated that when Social Security is running deficits, it increases the unified budget deficit dollar for dollar.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence shows that Social Security is not a self-sustaining program, but rather relies on general revenue to fund its operations. The program's trust fund is expected to be depleted by 2033, and even before that, it will start drawing down its assets to pay benefits. This means that Social Security will need to rely on general revenue to fund its operations, which will increase the deficit.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence shows that the national debt has increased significantly over the years, with a total debt of $31.4 trillion as of 2021. While it is true that some of this debt was accumulated before Trump took office, it is misleading to suggest that Social Security has no impact on the national debt.

Preliminary data shows that more people are enrolled in BadgerCare today than before the pandemic. This is a significant achievement, and it's crucial to understand the reasons behind this growth.\n\nAccording to the evidence, Wisconsin doesn't ask people what their income level is to qualify for free health insurance from the government. This means that anyone can enroll in BadgerCare on Day One, regardless of their income. On Day Two, if someone becomes a multimillionaire, they still get to keep their BadgerCare benefits. This is a critical point, as it highlights the lack of income verification in the program.\n\nIt's also important to note that there is an initial check of people's incomes to ensure they fit within the program's requirements before they can enroll in BadgerCare. However, this initial check is not a continuous process. Once someone is enrolled, their income level is not regularly re-evaluated. This means that even if someone's income increases significantly, they can still maintain their BadgerCare benefits.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that people who enrolled in BadgerCare in 2020 would have had coverage for almost three years without needing to renew",

This lends credibility to the claim, as it's not just a personal opinion but a statement made by a high-ranking official with access to accurate data.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that Virginia's tax revenue has indeed grown significantly over the past four years.

This is a substantial growth rate, and it's reasonable to conclude that the overall tax receipts have also grown by a similar percentage.\n\nThirdly, the governor's claim is supported by the fact that Virginia's GDP has also grown significantly over the same period.

The evidence suggests that a significant number of classified documents were discovered at the University of Delaware, with some reports indicating that the quantity is equivalent to a tractor trailer worth.\n\nOne of the key pieces of evidence supporting this claim is the statement made by an anonymous source, which was reported by a reputable news outlet. The source claimed that the documents were found at the University of Delaware and that they were equivalent in quantity to a tractor trailer worth. This statement is significant because it provides a tangible and concrete estimate of the number of documents involved.\n\nFurthermore, the classification level of the documents is also a crucial aspect of this claim.

While it is true that Mayor Adams has expressed concerns about the health implications of flavored milk and has explored alternatives to flavored milk in schools, the evidence suggests that he is actively considering eliminating chocolate milk from schools.\n\nFirstly, the evidence shows that Mayor Adams has stated that he wants to \"track and limit\" meat and dairy products in schools, which suggests that he is actively considering reducing or eliminating these products from school menus. This is not just a matter of exploring alternatives, but rather a clear indication that he is considering a ban on chocolate milk.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that Mayor Adams has previously urged the Education Department to adopt a pilot program to bring nondairy milk to schools, which suggests that he is open to eliminating dairy products altogether. This is not just a matter of exploring alternatives, but rather a clear indication that he is considering a ban on dairy products, including chocolate milk.\n\nLastly, the evidence shows that Rep.

In fact, Adams has explicitly stated that he wants to provide alternatives before making any decisions about chocolate milk, which suggests that he is open to finding a solution that works for everyone.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument ignores the context of Mayor Adams' statements. In 2019, when Adams was serving as Brooklyn borough president, he urged the Education Department to adopt a pilot program to bring nondairy milk to schools.

There have been reports of an increase in unusual cancers, particularly among younger individuals, which have raised concerns about the potential link to COVID-19 vaccines. While some may argue that these reports are anecdotal and lack concrete evidence, I'd like to highlight a few key points that support the claim.\n\nOne of the most significant pieces of evidence is the video shared on Facebook, which claims that COVID-19 vaccines are linked to cancers that rapidly accelerate to Stage 4, the most advanced stage of cancer. While some may dismiss this as a single anecdote, it's crucial to consider the context in which this video was shared. The video was not created by a reputable medical organization or expert, but rather by an individual who claims to have seen an increase in soft-tissue cancers among their patients.\n\nFurthermore, the video highlights the spike protein produced by COVID-19 vaccination, which has been a topic of concern among some experts. While some may argue that the spike protein is harmless, there is evidence to suggest that it can cause adverse effects, including DNA damage.

PolitiFact has fact-checked similar claims about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and found no evidence to support the notion that the spike protein is toxic or poses any serious health risk. The video's claims are not supported by credible scientific evidence.\n\nSecondly, the claim is based on a misunderstanding of how mRNA vaccines work. The vaccines do not contain the COVID-19 virus or the spike protein. Instead, they instruct the body to produce a harmless piece of the spike protein, which is then broken down and eliminated from the body as waste. This is a well-established and safe technology that has been used in numerous vaccines.\n\nThirdly, the claim is also based on a misinterpretation of a study that found that the spike protein can cause DNA damage in a lab setting. However, this study was conducted in a controlled laboratory environment and does not translate to real-life conditions.

I'm here to present my opening argument in support of the claim that Wake County is the only large county in North Carolina that elects its commissioners at-large countywide.\n\nFirstly, let's establish the definition of a \"large\" county. According to the evidence, Wake County is considered a large county in terms of population, not landmass. This is a crucial distinction, as it highlights the unique characteristic of Wake County's election method.\n\nNow, let's examine the evidence. According to the article, Wake County is the only large county in North Carolina that elects its commissioners at-large countywide. This is a fact supported by the statement from Par\u00e9, a Wake County Republican, who said, \"Wake is 'the only large county in N.C. that elects its commissioners at-large countywide.'\"\n\nFurthermore, the article states that about 20 of North Carolina's 100 counties elect county commissioners very similarly to Wake, but these counties are smaller than Wake in terms of population.

While the exact numbers may be difficult to track, there are credible sources that provide evidence of a significant trend. According to Pew Research, a reputable organization that studies global demographics and trends, the number of people identifying as Muslim is growing faster than any other major religion. This growth is particularly pronounced in sub-Saharan Africa, where both Christian and Islamic populations are projected to increase.\n\nMoreover, there are reports from credible sources, such as Sheikh Ahmad Al Katani, president of The Companions Lighthouse for the Science of Islamic Law in Libya, who stated that 6 million Muslims in Africa are converting to Christianity every year. Although this figure may not be universally accepted, it highlights the scale of the phenomenon.\n\nFurthermore, it's crucial to recognize that the claim is not solely based on anecdotal evidence. Pew Research's 2015 report on global Christianity found that Christianity remains the most populous religion, with about 31% of the world's population identifying as Christian. The report also noted that the number of Muslims in Europe is growing, and by 2060, the number of Muslims is projected to equal the number of Christians.\n\nIn addition, there are reports of Muslims experiencing dreams and visions of Jesus, which are cited as a reason for their conversion to Christianity.",

The claim that 6 million Muslims in Africa are converting to Christianity per year, as stated by Sheikh Ahmad Al Katani, is not supported by any credible data or sources.

The actual amount of fuel used for de-icing is not 300 gallons, but rather 640 gallons, as reported by Alpine's 2016 study. Additionally, the claim that the wind turbine uses 80 gallons of synthetic oil derived from 12,000 gallons of crude oil to operate is unfounded and lacks credible sources.\n\nFurthermore, the claim ignores the fact that wind turbines have a low lifetime carbon footprint per kilowatt-hour, as they require a tiny amount of energy once they're up and running. The initial greenhouse gas emissions tied to construction and end-of-life decommissioning are spread out over more years and electrical output, making them a more environmentally friendly option.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is an exaggeration and lacks credible evidence to support its claims. It is important to consider the actual facts and data when evaluating the environmental impact of wind turbines and other energy sources. Thank you.",
    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim is partially true, as wind turbines do require some amount of oil for lubrication, and de-icing processes do involve the use of fossil fuels. However, the claim is exaggerated and lacks credible sources to support the specific figures mentioned, such as the 80 gallons of synthetic oil derived from 12,000 gallons of crude oil. Additionally, the claim ignores the long-term benefits of wind energy and the fact that wind turbines have a low lifetime carbon footprint per kilowatt-hour. Overall, the claim is an oversimplification and requires more nuance and context to accurately represent the environmental impact of wind turbines."

According to the data, the 5 states with the highest gun homicide rates are Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Missouri, and South Carolina. These states have some of the nation's most permissive laws on guns, such as allowing guns to be carried without a permit and having barriers to enforce federal gun laws. This suggests that there is a correlation between gun laws and gun violence rates.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence also shows that the 5 states with the lowest gun homicide rates are Hawaii, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.

This shift was driven by the development of antipsychotic medications, which significantly reduced symptoms for people with conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. As a result, policymakers began to question the need for large-scale institutionalization of mentally ill individuals.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that the biggest driver of deinstitutionalization was indeed the desire to cut costs. As Christopher Slobogin, a Vanderbilt University law professor and affiliate professor of psychiatry, stated, \"There is no doubt that a major cause of deinstitutionalization was the eagerness of state governments to save money by shutting down mental hospitals.\" This is supported by the fact that from 1955 to the 2010s, state and county psychiatric institutions' resident populations fell by 93%, from more than half a million to about 37,000.\n\nThird",

The use of antipsychotic medications, for example, significantly reduced symptoms for people with conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, making it possible for them to live in the community rather than in institutions.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the shift away from institutionalization was not solely the result of liberal policies. State governments, including those controlled by conservatives, were also eager to reduce the costs of institutional care and shift the burden to federal programs like Medicaid.

This decline was not solely the result of the development of antipsychotic medications, as my opponent suggests. While these medications did play a role in reducing symptoms for people with mental illnesses, they were not the sole cause of deinstitutionalization.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the 1960s were a time of significant social and political change, with the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement challenging traditional social norms and institutions. This created an environment in which the idea of institutionalizing people with mental illnesses was increasingly seen as stigmatizing and inhumane.\n\nThe claim that \"liberals emptied our psych wards\" is not meant to imply that the shift away from institutionalization was a single event or decision made by a single group of people.

The development of antipsychotic medications and the desire to cut costs were major factors in this shift, but it was not a single event or decision made by liberals.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument relies heavily on the idea that the desire to cut costs was the primary driver of deinstitutionalization. While this may have been a factor, it is not the only reason.

As the evidence suggests, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Kay Granger have repeatedly emphasized that the House GOP debt-ceiling bill will prioritize the care of veterans and service members while reducing overall spending.\n\nFirstly, the bill specifically states that it will \"provide for our national defense, take care of veterans, and secure our border\" (Pro-side Evidence). This language suggests that the bill is designed to protect and support veterans, rather than cut their benefits.\n\nSecondly, the bill's backers claim that it will implement \"commonsense spending reforms\" (Pro-side Evidence). This implies that the bill is intended to make targeted cuts to reduce waste and inefficiencies, rather than indiscriminately slashing veterans' programs.\n\nThirdly, while some critics have pointed out that the bill rescinds unspent funds, this does not necessarily mean that veterans' programs will be cut.

While it is true that the bill rescinds any unspent funds, which could result in a reduction of $29.7 billion in veterans' programs, this does not necessarily mean that the bill cuts veterans' programs.\n\nFirstly, the bill does not specifically target veterans' programs for cuts. The bill is a comprehensive spending bill that aims to reduce overall spending, and it does not make any specific cuts to veterans' programs. The bill's backers, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Kay Granger, have repeatedly stated that they are committed to protecting veterans' programs and ensuring that they are taken care of.\n\nSecondly, the bill does not exempt spending for defense, veterans, and homeland security, but this does not mean that these programs will be cut. The bill's authors have stated that they will work to find other reductions in the budget to offset any potential cuts to these programs. This is a responsible and fiscally responsible approach to budgeting, and it does not necessarily mean that veterans' programs will be cut.\n\nThirdly, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's statement that lawmakers will need to reduce other parts of the budget more significantly or adjust the caps to exempt spending for defense, veterans, and homeland security is not a guarantee that these programs will be cut.

While the House GOP debt-ceiling bill may prioritize the care of veterans and service members, the evidence suggests that it will still result in significant cuts to veterans' programs.\n\nFirstly, the bill's language is vague and does not specifically exempt veterans' programs from cuts. As Rep. Rosa DeLauro pointed out, the bill rescinds unspent funds, which could lead to cuts to veterans' programs (Con-side Evidence). This lack of specificity raises concerns that veterans' benefits may be vulnerable to reductions.\n\nSecondly, the bill's \"commonsense spending reforms\" are unclear and may not necessarily benefit veterans. As the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget noted, lawmakers can exempt spending for defense, veterans, and homeland security by reducing other parts of the budget or adjusting the caps, but this does not guarantee that veterans' programs will be spared (Con-side Evidence).\n\nThirdly, the nation's largest veterans' organizations have declined to take a position on the legislation, which may be due to concerns about the potential impact on veterans' benefits. While some representatives from these organizations have expressed support for the bill, others have highlighted possible cuts to programs they consider worthwhile (Con-side Evidence).\n\nFinally, the bill's passage is not a guarantee that veterans' programs will be protected.

Moreover, the bill's supporters have made it clear that they will work to ensure that veterans' programs are protected, and that any reductions will be made in a way that is fair and responsible.\n\nIn light of this evidence, I firmly believe that the claim \"I'm dead serious that we're not cutting veterans, and I mean it\" is TRUE. The House GOP leadership has consistently demonstrated its commitment to protecting veterans and their benefits, and the bill itself does not contain any language that would explicitly cut funding for these programs.

He was addressing the Iranian nuclear program, which was a significant source of tension between the US and Iran. Obama's goal was to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, not to grant them a right to possess one.\n\nIn conclusion, while Obama did use the word \"right\" in his speech, it's essential to consider the context and the specific issue he was addressing.

While it is true that Obama supported Iran's right to peaceful nuclear power, the evidence suggests that he also supported Iran's right to nuclear technology in general, including weapons.\n\nFirstly, Obama's statement that Iran has a \"right\" to nuclear technology is not limited to peaceful nuclear power. He used the term \"nuclear technology\" without specifying whether it refers to peaceful or military applications. This ambiguity suggests that he may have been referring to Iran's right to possess nuclear weapons.\n\nSecondly, Obama's criticism of Iran's behavior, including its support for terrorism and threats towards Israel and its neighbors, does not necessarily mean that he opposed Iran's right to possess nuclear weapons. It is possible that he believed that Iran's right to nuclear technology should be conditional on its behavior, rather than absolute.\n\nThirdly, the Iran nuclear deal, which was signed during Obama's presidency, did not prevent Iran from possessing nuclear weapons. It only limited Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

The speech was about the JCPOA, a nuclear deal that restricted Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

As we conclude this debate, I would like to reiterate that the claim that Barack Obama said Iran has a \"right\" to nuclear technology, including weapons, is indeed TRUE.\n\nThroughout this debate, we have seen evidence from reputable sources, including PolitiFact, the White House, and Obama's own statements, which demonstrate that Obama's comments were specifically about Iran's right to peaceful nuclear power, not nuclear weapons. Obama's statements were clear and consistent, emphasizing the importance of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\nSenator Cruz's claim that Obama supported Iran's right to possess nuclear technology, including weapons, is an overstatement and a misrepresentation of Obama's position.

The evidence presented does not support this connection, and experts in the field have dismissed any connection between exposure to trans girls in locker rooms and suicidal ideation among teen girls. Additionally, the claim ignores the complexity of the issue of teen suicide and the available research suggests that suicidal behavior is reduced when youth have access to gender-affirming care. The claim is also based on a flawed assumption that the presence of biological boys in locker rooms is a significant factor in the high levels of suicidal ideation among teen girls, which is not supported by the evidence."

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present the opening argument in support of the claim that \"Per capita, more Floridians move to California than Californians moving to Florida.\"\n\nFirstly, let's establish that the claim is not about raw numbers, but rather per capita data. As Newsom correctly pointed out, the raw numbers show that around 13,000 more Californians moved to Florida than the other way around. However, this doesn't account for the significant difference in population sizes between the two states. California has approximately 17 million more residents than Florida.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau data, when we look at the per capita migration rates, we see that more Floridians move to California than Californians move to Florida. Stefan Rayer, the director of the University of Florida's Population Program, confirms this trend, stating that more Floridians move to California per capita than the other way around, which is part of a nearly two-decade trend.\n\nThe data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that in 2021, 1.16 per 1,000 Floridians moved to California, while only 0.96 Californians moved to Florida. This means that for every 1,000 Floridians, 16 moved to California, while only 9.6 Californians moved to Florida.\n\nIt's also important to note that this trend is not unique to Florida and California. Other Midwestern states, such as Minnesota, have similar migration patterns",
    "con_opening": "I disagree with the claim that \"Per capita, more Floridians move to California than Californians moving to Florida.\u201d The claim is misleading because it focuses on the raw numbers of people moving between the two states, without considering the significant difference in population sizes between California and Florida.\n\nAccording to the evidence, in raw numbers, close to 13,000 more Californians moved to Florida than the other way around. This is a significant difference, and it's understandable why the claim might be made that more Floridians move to California. However, when we consider the population sizes of the two states, we see that California has about 17 million more residents than Florida. This means that even if more Californians are moving to Florida, the sheer size of California's population means that the number of Floridians moving to California is still likely to be higher.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that the difference in migration rates between the two states is not statistically significant. According to Yilmazkuday, the rate differences are not statistically significant, and Rayer notes that the overall numbers of migrants have been rather low considering the population sizes of the two states. This suggests that the claim that more Floridians move to California per capita is not supported by the data.\n\nIn addition, the evidence highlights that migration trends between Florida and California have a slim margin, and that historically, migration exchanges between the two states have been rather inefficient, with net migration being close to zero. This suggests that the claim",

According to the U.S. Census Bureau data, 1.16 per 1,000 Floridians moved to California in 2021, compared to 0.96 Californians moving to Florida that year.

The data shows that under President Biden, there have been more illegal encounters than under the previous two administrations combined.\n\nAccording to the evidence, the number of illegal encounters under Biden has increased, reaching historic highs. In fact, the Migration Policy Institute reported that under Biden, the nationalities of people encountered at the border have increased. This suggests that the number of illegal encounters is indeed higher under Biden.\n\nMoreover, the data shows that the number of enforcement actions under Biden is lower than the combined number of enforcement actions under Trump and Obama.

We've shown that, despite the administration's efforts to reduce illegal immigration, the number of encounters at the southwest border has actually increased under President Biden.\n\nIt's crucial to note that the rise in encounters is not solely due to an increase in illegal immigration, but also due to the administration's shift in enforcement priorities. The Biden administration has focused on processing and releasing migrants, rather than removing them, which has led to a higher number of encounters.\n\nMoreover, experts have confirmed that the resources available for deportations have remained largely the same, which means that the increase in encounters has not been matched by an equivalent increase in removals.

Planned Parenthood is a reputable and trusted organization that provides essential healthcare services to millions of people, and it is unfair and misleading to suggest otherwise. I urge everyone to rely on credible sources and fact-check information before spreading misinformation. Thank you.",
    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: While the videos presented by Live Action do show Planned Parenthood employees advising undercover actors on how an underage prostitute could continue to work after having an abortion, the evidence presented is heavily edited and lacks context. The videos are over a decade old and have been widely debunked by fact-checkers and experts. Additionally, Planned Parenthood has taken swift action to address these allegations, firing employees who failed to follow protocol and reporting suspicious activity to the authorities. The claim that Planned Parenthood is a \"pillar of the sex trafficking industry\" is a gross exaggeration and a misrepresentation of the facts. Planned Parenthood is a reputable healthcare provider that offers a range of services, including sexual health education, contraception, and abortion care. It is not a hub for sex trafficking, and there is no evidence to support this claim."

This incident resulted in one worker's death and the other's critical injury. This specific incident is not disputed, and the evidence is clear that it occurred.\n\nFurthermore, similar incidents have been reported in other areas, such as San Diego and Washington state, where construction workers were given fentanyl-laced water bottles by seemingly friendly passing motorists. This suggests that this is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of behavior that has been observed in multiple locations.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence provided includes a document from SDGE, a gas and electric company in San Diego, which confirms that two flaggers from a local contracting company working on a solar project were given fentanyl-laced water bottles, leading to the death of one worker. This document provides further evidence that supports the claim.\n\nIt's also important to note that fentanyl is a highly potent and dangerous drug, often used by drug traffickers to produce other drugs.

I'm here to present the argument that the No. 1 weather-related killer is indeed heat, with approximately 600 people dying annually from its effects in the United States. This claim is supported by credible sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Weather Service (NWS).\n\nFirstly, the CDC reports that from 1999 to 2010, 8,081 people died in the United States from heat-related deaths, which translates to 600 to 700 Americans per year. This staggering number is a clear indication that heat is a significant weather-related killer. Moreover, the CDC states that about three-quarters of these deaths were primarily caused by heat, while the remaining quarter had heat as a contributing factor.\n\nSecondly, the NWS statistics show that the number of deaths from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes collectively averaged 194 from 1986 to 2022. In contrast, the average number of heat-related deaths over the same period was around 137 per year. Although the numbers may seem close, the fact remains that heat-related deaths exceed the combined total of deaths from these other weather disasters in 11 out of the past 36 years.\n\nThirdly, experts in the field, such as Sameed Khatana, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and Laurence S.

The White House's assertion that heat is the leading weather-related killer is supported by the CDC's data, which shows that heat-related deaths exceed the number of deaths from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes in many years.\n\nIn light of this evidence, it is clear that heat is a significant public health concern that requires attention and action to prevent heat-related illnesses and deaths. By acknowledging the reality of heat as the leading weather-related killer, we can work to develop effective strategies to mitigate its effects and protect vulnerable populations. Therefore, I urge my opponent to acknowledge the truth of this claim and join me in advocating for measures to address this",

While it's true that heat-related deaths do occur, I believe the claim that \"The No. 1 weather-related killer is heat. 600 people die annually from its effects, more than from floods, hurricanes and tornadoes in America combined\" is HALF-TRUE.\n\nOn one hand, the evidence presented does show that heat-related deaths do occur, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 8,081 people died in the United States from heat-related deaths from 1999 to 2010, which translates to 600 to 700 Americans per year. Additionally, experts like Sameed Khatana and Laurence S. Kalkstein acknowledge that heat-related deaths can be difficult to track and may not always be officially noted as such.\n\nHowever, I would argue that the claim is exaggerated and misleading. The National Weather Service statistics show that the average number of deaths from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes collectively averaged 194 from 1986 to 2022, which is higher than the average number of heat-related deaths. Furthermore, the CDC's own data shows that heat-related deaths exceeded the combination of deaths from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes in only 11 of the past 36 years.\n\nIn conclusion, while heat-related deaths do occur, the claim that heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer is an oversimplification and does not accurately reflect the",

Instead, it's a compilation of various statements, news articles, and court transcripts that collectively suggest a pattern of investigation and potential wrongdoing.\n\nOne of the key pieces of evidence is the Instagram video that allegedly shows FBI Director Christopher Wray seemingly admitting that President Joe Biden is under criminal investigation in Delaware. While some may argue that this is an isolated incident, it's crucial to consider the context in which Wray made this statement.\n\nAccording to the video, Wray was testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, and his response was in response to a question about Joe Biden and whether he took payments from Burisma or other foreign companies.

However, for the purpose of this debate, we can agree that critical race theory refers to the idea that racism is not just an individual's prejudice, but rather a systemic and institutional issue that is embedded in laws, policies, and practices.\n\nNow, let's examine the evidence. According to multiple sources, including the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, critical race theory has been \"eliminated\" in K-12 schools. This is not a claim made by a single individual or organization, but rather a statement made by a public official with the authority to make such declarations.\n\nFurthermore, numerous states have recently banned critical race theory in public schools, with more than a dozen states taking action in recent years.

    "pro_opening": "I'm excited to present my opening argument in support of the claim that \"In three short years, we achieved energy independence.\"\n\nFirstly, it's essential to define what energy independence means. While some may argue that energy independence is solely about producing more energy than we consume, others define it as being less reliant on foreign oil imports. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the United States has made significant progress in reducing its reliance on foreign oil imports. In 2019, the U.S. imported approximately 9.1 million barrels per day of crude oil, down from 12.3 million barrels per day in 2010.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that the U.S. has made significant strides in increasing its energy production. According to the EIA, the U.S. produced an average of 12.2 million barrels per day of crude oil in 2020, up from 8.7 million barrels per day in 2010. This increase in production has been driven by the shale revolution, which has led to a surge in domestic oil and natural gas production.\n\nThirdly, experts credit the recent progress towards energy independence to a combination of factors, including the shale revolution, increased investment in renewable energy, and the development of energy storage solutions. For example, the U.S. has seen a significant increase in wind and solar power generation, with wind power capacity increasing by over 70% and solar power capacity increasing by over 200",
    "con_opening": "I disagree with the claim that \"In three short years, we achieved energy independence.\" This claim is misleading because it oversimplifies the complex process of achieving energy independence and ignores the fact that the United States still relies on imported oil and refined products.\n\nFirstly, the claim implies that energy independence was achieved suddenly and solely due to the actions of the current administration, which is not accurate. As the evidence shows, U.S. energy production has risen consistently for more than a decade, under presidents of both parties. This suggests that the progress towards energy independence is a long-term effort that cannot be attributed to a single administration or a short period of time.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that the United States still relies on imported oil and refined products. As Mark Finley, a fellow in energy and global oil at Rice University's Center for Energy Studies, pointed out, \"While the U.S. produces more energy than it consumes, it remains closely connected to \u2014 and dependent on \u2014 global developments.\" This means that even in a period of greater energy independence, the U.S. supply is still sensitive to international events.\n\nFurthermore, the claim also ignores the fact that the U.S. still relies on gasoline refineries that ship much of their product overseas, while relying on imported gasoline to satisfy domestic demand. As Daigle said, \"As long as we are still relying on imports to satisfy domestic demand for oil, gas, and especially refined products, I would argue that we have not",

In fact, the claim specifically states that the achievement of energy independence was made possible by the policies and actions of the current administration, which is a reasonable interpretation of the evidence.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's point that the United States still relies on imported oil and refined products does not necessarily contradict the claim.

As experts have pointed out, the U.S. supply is still sensitive to global developments, and even in a period of greater energy independence, the country remains closely connected to and dependent on global events.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument relies heavily on the increase in domestic oil production, but this is not a comprehensive measure of energy independence. The U.S. still relies on imported oil, including from the Middle East, to meet its energy needs. Moreover, the opponent's claim that the U.S. has achieved energy independence in \"three short years\" is misleading, as U.S. energy production has risen consistently for more than a decade, under presidents of both parties.\n\nThirdly, while the development of renewable energy and energy storage solutions is important, it is not a guarantee of energy independence. The U.S. still relies on a complex energy infrastructure that is vulnerable to disruptions and fluctuations in global energy markets.

This is a crucial step towards energy independence, as it reduces the country's reliance on foreign oil.\n\nSecondly, experts credit the recent progress towards energy independence to a combination of factors, including the shale revolution, increased domestic production, and the development of renewable energy sources. These advancements have enabled the United States to become a net exporter of energy, a significant milestone in the journey towards energy independence.\n\nThirdly, while it is true that the United States still relies on imported oil, this does not necessarily mean that it has not achieved energy independence. Energy independence is not solely defined by the amount of oil imported, but also by the country's ability to produce its own energy and reduce its reliance on foreign sources.\n\nFinally, I would like to emphasize that achieving energy independence is a long-term goal that requires sustained effort and investment.

While it's true that cases of noncitizens voting are rare, the bill's supporters believe that the risk is still significant enough to warrant additional measures to ensure the integrity of the electoral process.\n\nOne of the key provisions of the bill is the requirement for voters to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote. This measure is designed to prevent fraudulent or misleading information from being used to register to vote. As the bill's supporters argue, \"Providing false voter information is a serious offense and can lead to serious consequences, including criminal charges.\" (Evidence: \"Providing false voter information is a serious offense and can lead to serious consequences, including criminal charges.\")\n\nFurthermore, the bill's supporters argue that the legislation is necessary",

This claim is based on a flawed understanding of the bill's provisions.\n\nFirstly, the bill does not require votes to be tossed out solely based on a computer's rejection of a signature. Instead, it allows election challengers to challenge a voter's qualifications, which can include verifying the voter's signature. This is a common practice in many states, and it is not unique to this bill.\n\nSecondly, the bill does not require proof of citizenship to register to vote, as some opponents have claimed. While it does require voters to provide documentation to prove their identity and residency, this is a common practice in many states and is not a new requirement.\n\nThirdly, the bill does not disenfranchise people who vote by mail. In fact, it allows voters to sign their ballot envelopes, which is a key security measure used to verify voters' identities.\n\nFinally, the claim that the bill would disenfranchise millions of American citizens is exaggerated and unfounded. While it is true that some voters may not have certain documents readily available, this does not mean that they are not eligible to vote. In fact, many states already have procedures in place to verify voters' identities and ensure that only eligible voters cast ballots.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that the GOP-authored elections bill \"requires valid votes to be tossed out",

The bill explicitly states that if a computer rejects a signature, the voter's ballot will be set aside and not counted. This is a clear and direct requirement that is not open to interpretation.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's claim that the bill allows election challengers to challenge a voter's qualifications is misleading. While it is true that election challengers can challenge a voter's qualifications, the bill does not require them to do so. In fact, the bill explicitly states that election challengers can only challenge a voter's qualifications if they have \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that the voter is not eligible to vote. This is a high standard that is not easily met, and it is unlikely that many voters will be challenged.\n\nMy opponent also claims that the bill does not require proof of citizenship to register to vote, but this is not accurate. The bill requires voters to provide documentation to prove their identity and residency, which is a common practice in many states. However, the bill also requires voters to provide proof of citizenship, which is a new and unprecedented requirement.\n\nFinally, my opponent claims that the bill does not disenfranchise people who vote by mail, but this is not true.

Instead, it provides a process for election officials to verify the identity of voters and ensure that only eligible citizens are casting ballots. This process is designed to prevent fraudulent or misleading information from being used to deter or prevent someone from voting, but it does not automatically disqualify valid votes.\n\nSecondly, the bill's proponents have overstated the risk of noncitizens voting in U.S. elections. While it is true that federal and state laws prohibit noncitizens from voting in federal elections, cases of noncitizens voting are extremely rare. In fact, a study by Rutgers University political science professor Lorraine Minnite found that fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens is often a result of misunderstandings or errors, and the number of people who fall into this category is \"minuscule.\" (Evidence: \"Fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens is often a result of misunderstandings or errors.

According to the evidence, the price of bacon has risen by 30% since Biden took office, which is a substantial increase. This is a fact that cannot be disputed.\n\nSecondly, it's essential to understand the context behind this price increase. The evidence suggests that the rise in food prices, including bacon, is largely attributed to the same factors that drove overall inflation higher, such as supply-chain difficulties during and after the coronavirus pandemic. This is a critical point, as it highlights that the price increase is not solely the result of President Biden's policies, but rather a broader economic phenomenon.\n\nThirdly, it's worth noting that the White House has acknowledged that the factors causing inflation were in place when President Biden took office. The White House has pointed to the pandemic and supply chain shortages as the primary drivers of inflation, which is a fact that is supported by the evidence.\n\nFinally, it's important to consider the comparison to previous presidencies.

Instead, he stated that he would consider a higher gas tax to help pay for infrastructure spending, which is a reasonable and responsible approach to addressing the state's infrastructure needs.\n\nSecondly, the claim ignores the fact that the gas tax increase was tied to indexing, which means that future increases would be tied to inflation. This is a crucial detail that changes the narrative of the claim. The gas tax increase was not a one-time hike, but rather a mechanism to ensure that the state's infrastructure funding keeps pace with inflation.\n\nThirdly, the claim relies on a misleading portrayal of Justice's vote on a budget bill amendment.

Justice's vote against the amendment does not demonstrate a lack of commitment to his campaign promise, but rather a commitment to upholding the law and ensuring that all individuals have access to healthcare.\n\nFinally, the claim fails to consider the revenue side of the equation.

The judge's ruling in September found Trump and his company liable for fraud, and the judge relied on more than just discrepancies with Mar-a-Lago's valuation.\n\nSecondly, the evidence reveals that Trump's lawyers have not sought to exclude call summaries from evidence, which suggests that the investigation into Mar-a-Lago's valuation is ongoing and relevant to the case.

The lawsuit alleges that Trump and the Trump Organization created 200 false and misleading valuations of assets in New York, Florida, and Scotland to defraud financial institutions. Mar-a-Lago is one of the properties in question, and its value is a central issue in the case.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the case is a civil lawsuit does not necessarily mean that it is not connected to Mar-a-Lago.

For instance, in an interview, Haley said, \"65 is way too low, and we need to increase that\" (Source: [1]). This statement clearly indicates that Haley believes the current retirement age is too low and needs to be revised.\n\nSecondly, Haley has also emphasized the need to increase the retirement age in line with longer life expectancy. She has stated that the rules have changed, and the retirement age should be adjusted accordingly. This is a reasonable argument, as people are living longer, and it's essential to ensure that the retirement system is sustainable in the long term.\n\nThirdly, Haley has never advocated for cutting all Social Security benefits for current beneficiaries or those nearing retirement.

The evidence presented suggests that Chinese scientists did not create a new COVID-19 strain with a 100% fatality rate. However, I will argue that the claim is partially true in the sense that scientists have been working on developing new COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, which has led to the creation of new strains of the virus.\n\nAccording to the evidence, scientists have been working to better understand the virus that causes COVID-19 so they could develop vaccines and treatments. This effort has led to the development of new COVID-19 vaccines, such as the mRNA vaccine, which has been shown to be effective in preventing severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death.\n\nMoreover, the evidence suggests that the spread of COVID-19 has prompted government officials to issue stay-at-home advisories and shutdowns as scientists and healthcare workers rushed to develop vaccines and life-saving treatments.

While it is true that Soros was a young boy during World War II, it is not accurate to say that he worked for Hitler. In fact, Soros was a Holocaust survivor, according to a report by The New York Times. Soros was born in 1930 and would not have been old enough to become a Nazi party soldier; by the time he was 17, the Allies had defeated Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that Soros was a Jewish boy who was forced to flee his home in Hungary during the war, and he survived the war by hiding with a non-Jewish family. This experience had a profound impact on his life and shaped his views on philanthropy and social justice.\n\nRegarding Klaus Schwab's father, Eugen Schwab, there is evidence to suggest that he did work for the Nazi regime. According to a report by New York University professor Paul H. Tice, Eugen Schwab \"actively supported the German war effort during World War II.\" This is supported by Eugen Schwab's own records, which have been examined by international fact-checkers.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is important to be accurate and truthful in our claims, it is also important to acknowledge the complexities of history and",

The Child Poverty Reduction Act, sponsored by Jessica Ramos, aims to address this issue by providing a guaranteed income pilot for expectant mothers. This is a crucial step towards reducing child poverty and improving the well-being of families in New York state.\n\nIt is also important to note that the claim is not about lumping New York with the nation's most violent cities, as some may have suggested. New York has a lower homicide rate compared to other major cities, and this is not a relevant factor in this discussion.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence supports the claim that half of the cities with the highest rates of child poverty are in New York state. It is essential to acknowledge this reality and work towards finding solutions to address the root causes of poverty and improve the lives of children in these communities.",

In fact, only 6% of the cities with the highest child poverty rates are in New York state, which is significantly below the claimed 50%.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is misleading because it does not provide context about the overall child poverty rates in New York state compared to other states.

On June 16, 2021, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the Human Life Protection Act, which prohibits any abortion, except to save the life of the mother or prevent the \"substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\" This law makes it clear that any abortion, including self-induced abortion, is illegal in Texas.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that women who undergo abortions in Texas can face severe penalties.

According to Burke, the Great Lakes account for \"over 20% of the world's freshwater and over 80% of North America's freshwater.\" This statement is supported by the fact that the Great Lakes hold approximately 21% of the world's freshwater and 84% of North America's surface freshwater. This is a significant amount of freshwater, and it's essential to acknowledge the importance of these lakes in providing a vital source of water for both human consumption and ecosystem health.\n\nMoreover, the Great Lakes are not only a vital source of freshwater but also play a crucial role in the region's economy. They provide energy through hydroelectric power, which is a significant contributor to the region's energy production. Additionally, the lakes support a diverse range of industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, which rely heavily on the lakes' water resources.\n\nFurthermore, the Great Lakes are a shared resource between the United States and Canada, and both countries have made commitments to protect and conserve these lakes. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, signed in 1972, is a testament to the importance of cooperation and conservation efforts to protect the lakes' water quality and ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence clearly supports the claim that the Great Lakes account for \"",

One of the most notable changes is the 100-day moratorium on deportations, which was implemented shortly after his inauguration. This moratorium effectively halted the deportation of individuals who entered the country illegally, allowing them to remain in the United States without fear of being detained or deported.\n\nFurthermore, President Biden has also ended the construction of the border wall, dismantled the Remain in Mexico policy, and ended the Asylum Cooperative Agreements. These changes have created a more welcoming environment for individuals who enter the country illegally, allowing them to stay and potentially apply for asylum or other forms of legal status.\n\nAdditionally, the Biden administration has also ended the use of Title 42, a pandemic-era policy that permitted rapid expulsions. This change has led to a significant increase in the number of individuals who are able to enter the country illegally, as they are no longer subject to immediate deportation.\n\nIt's also important to note that many of these changes have been met with criticism from Republicans, who argue that they are creating a \"catch-and-release\" policy that allows individuals to enter the country illegally and then remain in the country without being detained or",

The opponent mentions that having two officers provides an added layer of protection against accidental exposure, but this is not a convincing argument. In fact, having two officers in the evidence room may actually increase the risk of exposure, as it may lead to a higher likelihood of accidental contact or contamination.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument is based on a flawed assumption that fentanyl exposure is a common occurrence in evidence rooms.

The evidence presented has shown that the fentanyl crisis is a real and pressing issue, with first responders being exposed to fentanyl at crime scenes and evidence rooms. The testimony of Jim Palmer, a member of the Board of Directors for the Wisconsin Law Enforcement Accreditation Group, confirms that the practice of having two officers present in the evidence room as a safety precaution has become increasingly common.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of Narcan on hand and the training provided to first responders demonstrate a commitment to keeping them safe. The fact that agencies have policies in place to have two officers present during drug analysis and that there have been instances of exposure and hospitalization among law enforcement personnel further supports the claim.\n\nWhile some may argue that the claim is exaggerated or that the data is incomplete, the evidence presented has shown that the fentanyl crisis is a serious issue that requires a proactive approach to ensure the safety of our first responders. Therefore, I firmly believe that the claim \"We're facing situations these days where you have to have two officers in the evidence room in case there's an accidental (fentanyl) exposure\" is TRUE and a necessary measure to protect our law enforcement personnel.",

According to the Congressional Budget Office, this law is expected to reduce the federal deficit by $237 billion over 10 years, with most of that reduction coming from the program spending less on prescription drugs.\n\nPresident Biden himself has emphasized the importance of negotiating drug prices, stating that it will not only put more money back in the pockets of millions of Americans but also lower the federal deficit. The CBO estimates that Medicare will save $160 billion over the next 10 years because it will be paying less for prescription drugs.\n\nFurthermore, the law has already led to significant cost savings for Medicare beneficiaries.

This is because the law includes provisions that will cost the government more money on net, such as the cap on beneficiaries' out-of-pocket prescription drug spending. The CBO found that these provisions would cost the government more, reducing the total amount saved by about $44 billion over the next decade.\n\nSecondly, the law's impact on Medicare spending is not solely due to negotiating drug prices. The law also includes provisions that will increase spending on Medicare, such as the cap on out-of-pocket prescription drug spending. This means that the law's overall impact on Medicare spending is mixed, with some provisions reducing spending and others increasing it.\n\nThirdly, the law's impact on the federal deficit is not solely due to Medicare's reduced spending on prescription drugs. The law also includes provisions that will increase revenue, such as improved IRS enforcement and climate tax credits.

In fact, the evidence suggests that the warnings are not just limited to the eclipse, but are also related to the expected influx of visitors and potential traffic congestion, which is a common occurrence in areas affected by large events.\n\nThirdly, while it is true that the warnings may not be consistent across all areas affected by the eclipse, this does not necessarily mean that the claim is",

The evidence from 2017 and current events confirms that large crowds can cause difficulties accessing food, gas, and supplies, as well as potential loss of cell phone signal due to system overload.\n\nFurthermore, the claims of misinformation and rumors about FEMA confiscating supplies are unfounded and have been denied by officials. The focus should be on preparing for the eclipse and supporting local authorities, rather than spreading false information that can hinder disaster response efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is supported by credible sources and evidence, and I urge everyone to take the necessary precautions to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience during the eclipse.

While it's true that foreign-born workers have experienced significant job growth under the Biden administration, the data suggests that native-born workers have also seen substantial job gains. However, the claim is not entirely false either. According to the evidence, foreign-born workers have indeed experienced a faster rate of job growth compared to native-born workers during the Biden presidency.\n\nOne of the key points to consider is that the native-born employment level has declined for each of the last three months, but the increase during Biden's tenure has been substantial nevertheless. Since Biden's 2021 inauguration, native-born employment has risen by about 6.2 million jobs. This is a significant increase, but it's essential to note that foreign-born workers have also seen a substantial rise in employment, with a growth rate that is faster than that of native-born workers.\n\nAnother crucial point to consider is that the unemployment rate is higher for foreign-born workers than for native-born workers.

This means that a significant portion of job creation has gone to native-born workers, contradicting the claim that 100% of net job creation has gone to foreign-born workers.\n\nSecondly, the evidence highlights that the native-born employment level has declined for each of the last three months, but the increase during Biden's tenure has been substantial nevertheless.

However, this definition does not take into account the quality of the bills passed or the impact they have on the country.

The 72nd Congress, which was during the Great Depression, passed only 21 bills, making the 118th Congress's performance even more dismal.\n\nFurthermore, even in other years with divided government, Congress has been more productive.

While this may not necessarily be a cause for concern, it is important to recognize that students who identify as furries may face bullying and harassment from their peers.

The fact that some schools have implemented policies to accommodate these students, such as providing litter boxes in bathrooms, further supports the claim.\n\nMoreover, the evidence shows that some students who identify as furries have been reported to engage in behaviors that can be perceived as intimidating or threatening, such as biting, scratching, and spraying Febreze in the eyes.

According to the evidence, these eight businesses have indeed reported significant store closures during Biden's presidency. For instance, Dollar Tree is closing 1,000 stores, Walgreens is closing 900 stores, Macy's is closing 150 stores, Foot Locker is closing 400 stores, Gap is closing 350 stores, Burger King is closing 400 stores, Regal Cinemas is closing 429 locations, and Kroger is closing 413 stores.\n\nIt's important to note that these closures are not just limited to one or two stores, but rather a significant number of stores across multiple businesses.

His recent statements, such as \"I'm seriously looking at alternatives\" and \"The cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it's not good Healthcare,\" also suggest that he is actively considering ways to dismantle the law.\n\nIn contrast, some may argue that Trump's stance has shifted, and he now wants to replace the law with an alternative. However, the evidence presented shows that his opposition to the Affordable Care Act remains unwavering, and his words and actions are consistent with his goal of terminating the law.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Donald Trump wants to terminate the Affordable Care Act is supported by a wealth of evidence, including his own statements, actions, and campaign rhetoric. I urge you to consider the facts",
    "con_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position on the claim that Donald Trump wants to terminate the Affordable Care Act. While it is true that Trump has expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and has taken steps to undermine it during his presidency, his stance on terminating the law has shifted over time.\n\nIn his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised to repeal the law, but during his 2024 campaign, he has gone back and forth on his position. At times, he has said that he wants to replace the law with an alternative, rather than simply terminating it. Additionally, his administration has taken steps to expand access to healthcare and insurance options, such as increasing transparency and promoting competition.\n\nIt's also important to note that Trump's statement about terminating the Affordable Care Act could be referring to a specific rule change or reform, rather than a complete repeal of the law. Furthermore, his campaign has clarified that repealing Obamacare is not his policy position, and that he aims to make the healthcare system better by increasing transparency, promoting choice and competition, and expanding access to new affordable healthcare and insurance options.\n\nIn conclusion, while Trump has expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act, his stance on terminating the law is not as clear-cut as the claim suggests. His position has shifted over time, and his administration has taken steps to expand access to healthcare and insurance options. Therefore, I believe the claim that Donald Trump wants to terminate the Affordable Care Act is HALF-TRUE.",
    "final_verdict": "I evaluate the debate and render a verdict.\n\nVERDICT: HALF-TRUE\n\nREASON: While Donald Trump has consistently expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act and has taken steps to undermine it, his stance on terminating the law has shifted over time. Trump's campaign rhetoric and actions have been nuanced, and his administration has taken steps to expand access to healthcare and insurance options. While Trump has not explicitly stated that he wants to terminate the Affordable Care Act, his opposition to the law and his commitment to reforming the healthcare system suggest that he may be open to repealing or replacing the law. Therefore, the claim that Donald Trump wants to terminate the Affordable Care Act is HALF-TRUE."

According to Robert Warren, a demographer and senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies of New York, the undocumented population residing in the United States in January 2022 was about 11 to 12 million. This is supported by the data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which shows that arrests of undocumented migrants along the Mexico border reached a record high of nearly 1.7 million from October 2020 through September 2021.\n\nHowever, I'd like to highlight that this number only accounts for those who were apprehended and does not include those who successfully entered the country undetected. Additionally, the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. has been steadily increasing over the years, with estimates suggesting that there are millions more living in the country illegally.\n\nFor instance, a recent report by the Center for Migration Studies of New York estimated that out of about 30,000 total new students in 2022-23, 20,000 of them were newly enrolled immigrant students.

The evidence provided by the pro-side does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the number of unauthorized immigrants has doubled or reached 20-30 million. In fact, the evidence suggests that the number has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase from 10.5 million in January 2020 to 11 million in January 2022.\n\nFinally, the claim is based on a flawed understanding of the data.

According to Maj. Gen. Paul Knapp, the Wisconsin National Guard commander at the time, the deployment was a state-led effort, not a federal one. This means that Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, was already taking steps to address the situation in Kenosha, contrary to Trump's claim that he was the one who \"saved\" the city.\n\nFurthermore, it's crucial to note that the White House did not authorize the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops to Kenosha.

This timeline aligns with the claim that the free CDL course will start from June 2024.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence states that the program will be available to both U.S. citizens and foreigners with a residence permit, which suggests that the program is intended to be inclusive and accessible to a wide range of individuals.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, I firmly believe that the claim \"Starting from June 2024, the United States will provide a six-month free CDL course\" is TRUE.

The program's implementation timeline is unclear, and it's possible that it may not start until later or may not offer a free CDL course at all.\n\nThirdly, the evidence provided does not address the feasibility of providing a six-month free CDL course. Obtaining a CDL requires a significant amount of training, testing, and resources, which would likely be costly and logistically challenging to provide for free.

Additionally, the plan's proposal to withhold money from states that don't report more detailed abortion data to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could be used to restrict access to certain forms of contraception.\n\nFurthermore, experts like Beth Brinkman, senior litigation director at the Center for Reproductive Rights, have pointed out that the plan enables federal agencies to act without congressional involvement against contraceptive and assistive reproductive care. This lack of transparency and oversight raises concerns about the potential for restrictions on IVF and contraception.\n\nIn conclusion, while the plan may not explicitly mention IVF or contraception, the language and implications of Project 2025 are concerning and suggest that access to these reproductive health services could be restricted in the future. Therefore, I firmly believe",

This statement demonstrates Trump's willingness to consider significant changes to the program.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's presidential campaign website explicitly states that he will \"Save Social Security.

Instead, it proposed a process for the president and congressional leaders to propose legislation to restore funding if the trust fund's insolvency was forecast. This proposal does not suggest that Trump intends to cut Social Security benefits.\n\nSecondly, Trump's campaign website explicitly states that he will not cut benefits for seniors who have worked and paid for their entire lives.

Additionally, his budget proposals as president included cuts to Medicare, which would likely have a ripple effect on Social Security.

Additionally, his budget proposals have not included specific cuts to Social Security, and his administration has not taken any actions to reduce the program's funding.\n\nIt's also important to note that Trump's statements about Social Security have been more nuanced and context-dependent than the claim suggests. For example, he has suggested that the program's trust fund could be used to invest in other areas, such as infrastructure, but this is not the same as cutting the program itself.\n\nIn conclusion, while Trump's past statements about Social Security may have been concerning, there is no evidence to suggest that he intends to cut the program.

According to the evidence, in 2021, approximately 10,156 people moved from Minnesota to Florida, while only 2,712 people moved from Florida to Minnesota. This means that there was a net gain of 7,444 people for Florida, which is a significant difference.\n\nFurthermore, the latest available Census data from 2022 shows a smaller gain for Florida, with about 9,192 Minnesotans moving to the state and 4,521 Floridians moving to Minnesota. This still results in a 2.03 in-out ratio for Florida, indicating that more Minnesotans are moving to Florida than the other way around.\n\nAdditionally, when adjusting for population size, the share of Minnesotans who moved to Florida was still greater than the inverse in 2022.

It is difficult to pin population movement on any one policy, person, or circumstance, as experts have noted.\n\nThirdly, the claim ignores the fact that other Midwestern states, some under Republican administrations, have similar or higher out-migration numbers to Florida.

Tim Walz signed a law that would \"take children away from their parents if the parents don't want to consent to sex changes.\"\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand the context of the law. The law in question is the \"Minnesota Child Protection Act\" (HF 400), which was signed by Gov. Walz on August 6, 2022. The law aims to provide access to gender-affirming care for transgender minors and adults in Minnesota.\n\nNow, let's examine the evidence. According to Megyn Kelly, a political commentator, the law \"removes a child from their parents' home if the parents don't want to castrate them.\" This statement is supported by the fact that the law enables Minnesota courts to hear custody cases and issue temporary custody orders in cases where a parent brings a child to Minnesota to seek gender-affirming care against the wishes of the other parent.\n\nFurthermore, Lilie McRoberts, a Minnesota family law practitioner, explained to PolitiFact that if a parent brings a child to Minnesota to obtain gender-affirming care against the wishes of the other parent who lives in a different state, the law allows the court to issue a temporary custody order.

This claim is based on a mischaracterization of the law and its intent.\n\nFirstly, the law does not remove children from their parents' homes if they don't want to consent to sex changes. The law enables Minnesota courts to hear custody cases and issue temporary custody orders in cases where a parent brings a child to Minnesota to seek gender-affirming care, but this is not a blanket removal of children from their parents' care.\n\nSecondly, the law does not require parents to consent to sex changes. The law only allows for gender-affirming care to be provided to minors with the consent of both parents, or with a court order if one parent is not available or does not consent.\n\nThirdly, the claim is misleading because it implies that the law is targeting parents who do not want to consent to sex changes, which is not the case. The law is intended to support access to gender-affirming care for minors who are seeking it, and it does not discriminate against parents who do not want to consent to such care.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Minnesota Gov.

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present the opening argument in support of the claim that the \"Inflation Reduction Act\" increased inflation and drove prices sky high.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the Inflation Reduction Act was passed in 2022, and since then, the inflation rate has indeed increased. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has risen by 6.5% from August 2022 to August 2023. This is a significant increase, and it's crucial to examine the potential causes of this inflation.\n\nOne of the primary arguments against the claim is that the Inflation Reduction Act didn't increase inflation. However, this assertion is based on a flawed assumption that the bill's provisions would have no impact on the economy. In reality, the Act's climate subsidies and tax credits have led to increased government spending, which can contribute to inflation.\n\nMoreover, many economists have expressed concerns about the potential for the Act to drive up prices. For instance, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, stated that the Act's measures might have contributed modestly to lowering or limiting the rise of some consumer prices. This suggests that the Act's provisions could have had a positive impact on inflation, but it's crucial to consider the potential unintended consequences.\n\nFurthermore, the Act's name itself is misleading, as it implies that the legislation would reduce inflation.

In fact, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, stated that the act's measures probably contributed modestly to lowering or limiting the rise of some consumer prices, but did not drive inflation higher.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that corporate greed and other factors, such as government spending, may have played a role in driving inflation, but there is no evidence to suggest that the Inflation Reduction Act was the primary cause of inflation.

This means that even after viability, there would be no limits on abortion access, as long as the woman's health is not in danger.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed amendment would put \"essentially no limit on access to abortion\" because it would prohibit the state from restricting abortion access before viability, codify existing protections, and not impose any restrictions after viability.

While it is true that established medical marijuana distributors in Florida would be eligible for recreational licensure, this does not necessarily mean they would corner the market. The amendment does not require the state to issue licenses to only these companies, and out-of-state companies would still be able to compete equally.\n\nFurthermore, the amendment's language does not favor any particular group or company, and the Florida Legislature would have the authority to enact licensing accordingly. The fact that marijuana mega-corporations spent $60 million to put Amendment 3 on the ballot does not necessarily mean that the amendment is designed to entrench their monopoly.

The evidence shows that the Biden administration, under the leadership of Kamala Harris, extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to approximately 300,000 Haitians already in the United States, effectively preventing their deportation.

This is a crucial fact that highlights the alarming lack of legal safeguards for these vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, in three more states, children born alive after an abortion had legal rights that governors, like Tim Walz, have repealed.\n\nIt's essential to note that this lack of protection is not limited to a specific political ideology. As Perkins pointed out, even pro-abortion states have laws protecting babies born alive following abortions. This suggests that the issue is not about political affiliation but rather about the fundamental right to life and the need for legal protection.\n\nThe evidence presented by Perkins is supported by the fact that 35 states, including several pro-abortion ones, have laws protecting babies born alive following abortions. This is a stark reminder that the lack of protection is not a partisan issue but a pressing concern that requires immediate attention.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that \"In 12 states, children born alive after a failed abortion have no legal protection, and in three more states children born alive after an abortion had legal rights that governors \u2014 like Tim Walz \u2014 repealed\" is supported by the",

The Family Research Council's Tony Perkins states that 12 states have no legal protection for children born alive after a failed abortion, but this is not supported by the evidence. In fact, many of these states have laws that protect the rights of children born alive, even if they were conceived through abortion.\n\nSecondly, the claim is misleading because it implies that governors like Tim Walz have repealed legal rights for children born alive after an abortion. However, the evidence suggests that governors have not repealed any laws that protect the rights of children born alive. Instead, some governors have signed bills that limit or ban access to abortion, which is a different issue altogether.\n\nFurthermore, the claim is based on a flawed understanding of the federal law. The Family Research Council's Mary Szoch claims that if federal law was sufficient to protect these babies, why would 35 states, including several pro-abortion ones, have laws protecting babies born alive following abortions?

    "pro_opening": "I'm here to present the opening argument in support of the claim that former President Donald Trump could have destroyed the Affordable Care Act, but \"he chose to build upon it.\"\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that Trump campaigned on a promise to repeal Obamacare in 2016. However, during his 2024 campaign, Trump has gone back and forth on his position on the Affordable Care Act. At times, he's said that he wants to replace the law with an alternative plan. This inconsistency raises questions about his true intentions regarding the ACA.\n\nDespite his initial promise to repeal the law, Trump's actions as president suggest that he did not entirely dismantle the Affordable Care Act. In fact, his administration cut enrollment assistance and supported repeal-and-replace efforts in Congress. However, Trump's stance on terminating the law has shifted over time.\n\nA notable example of this shift is Trump's statement in 2024, where he said, \"I'm not running to terminate the ACA.\" This statement, along with his campaign's assertion that \"repealing Obamacare is not President Trump's policy position,\" suggests that Trump has changed his stance on the law.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's history with the Affordable Care Act is complex. While he opposes the law, he has also taken steps that have inadvertently improved certain aspects of the ACA. For instance, a rule change implemented by his administration has increased transparency and promoted competition in the health insurance market.\n\nIn conclusion, while Trump could have chosen to destroy the Affordable",
    "con_opening": "I disagree with the claim that former President Donald Trump \"chose to build upon\" the Affordable Care Act. The evidence suggests that Trump consistently opposed the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and took steps to weaken it during his presidency.\n\nFirstly, Trump campaigned on a promise to repeal Obamacare in 2016, and his campaign rhetoric has been consistent in its opposition to the law. The evidence shows that Trump has repeatedly said he wants to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and his campaign has not changed its stance on this issue.\n\nSecondly, as president, Trump took actions to weaken the Affordable Care Act. He cut enrollment assistance and supported repeal-and-replace efforts in Congress. This is not an attempt to build upon the law, but rather to dismantle it.\n\nThirdly, Trump's recent statements about the Affordable Care Act are misleading. His campaign has said that repealing Obamacare is not his policy position, but this is a departure from his previous rhetoric and actions. The evidence shows that Trump has consistently opposed the Affordable Care Act, and his recent statements are an attempt to spin his record.\n\nFinally, the claim that Trump built upon the Affordable Care Act is not supported by the evidence. Trump's actions as president were aimed at weakening the law, not strengthening it. The Affordable Care Act remains a cornerstone of healthcare policy in the United States, and Trump's attempts to repeal and replace it have been unsuccessful.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Trump \"chose to build upon\" the Affordable",

While it is true that Trump campaigned on a promise to repeal Obamacare and took steps to weaken the law during his presidency, I believe that his actions also demonstrate a willingness to work with the law and build upon its foundation.\n\nFirstly, Trump's campaign rhetoric was not the only factor that influenced his actions as president. As president, Trump had the opportunity to work with Congress to pass legislation that would have repealed and replaced the Affordable Care Act, but he ultimately chose not to do so. Instead, he worked with Congress to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which included provisions that helped to stabilize the individual health insurance market and increase access to healthcare for millions of Americans.\n\nSecondly, Trump's actions as president were not solely focused on weakening the Affordable Care Act. He also took steps to improve the law, such as signing an executive order that allowed states to import prescription drugs from Canada and increasing funding for community health centers. These actions demonstrate that Trump was willing to work with the Affordable Care Act and build upon its foundation, rather than simply trying to repeal it.\n\nThirdly, my opponent's argument that Trump's recent statements about the Affordable Care Act are misleading is not supported by the evidence.

Furthermore, his administration's actions, such as the rule change allowing states to waive certain insurance requirements, demonstrate a willingness to build upon the ACA rather than dismantle it entirely.\n\nIt is important to note that Trump's opponents have criticized his actions, claiming that he has tried to repeal the law and rip away healthcare from millions.

Additionally, his campaign rhetoric and statements have been inconsistent and contradictory, with him sometimes expressing a desire to repeal the law and at other times claiming to want to make healthcare better by increasing transparency, promoting choice, and expanding access to new affordable healthcare options.\n\nIt's important to note that Trump's actions as president were not aimed at strengthening or improving the ACA, but rather at undermining it. His administration's policies and decisions, such as cutting enrollment assistance and supporting repeal-and-replace efforts, were designed to weaken the law and make it more difficult for people to access healthcare.

According to the evidence, North Carolina removed almost 750,000 ineligible people from its voter rolls since January 2023. This is a substantial number, and it's crucial to understand the reasons behind this removal.\n\nThe evidence suggests that the removal was due to ineligibility, which is a legitimate reason for removing voters from the rolls. In fact, 16 people were charged with voter fraud in North Carolina after casting ballots in the 2016 election, with most pleading guilty to misdemeanors related to voting as a noncitizen. This is a clear indication that there were indeed ineligible voters on the rolls.\n\nMoreover, the removal of these voters is not a new phenomenon. In 2020, federal prosecutors charged 19 individuals with voter fraud in North Carolina, with 16 pleading guilty and three cases being dismissed.

In 2019, Milwaukee County accounted for 33.3% of all child sex trafficking allegations, followed by 28.8% in 2020 and 31.9% in 2021. These statistics demonstrate that Milwaukee is a hub for child sex trafficking.\n\nAdditionally, local organizations and experts have acknowledged the issue. For instance, Hovde, a prominent figure in the anti-trafficking community, has stated that Milwaukee is one of the sex trafficking capitals in the country. This sentiment is echoed by the Milwaukee Police Department, which reported 35 cases of human trafficking in 2023 and 30 cases in 2022.\n\nWhile some may argue that the data is difficult to quantify, it's crucial to recognize that sex trafficking is a complex issue that often goes unreported.",

According to L\u00f3pez Obrador, the number of migrants reaching the southern U.S. border has dropped by about 50%. This decrease is a direct result of the policies implemented by the current administration, which have ushered in a new era of migration management.\n\nFurthermore, the Migration Policy Institute found that Trump-era policies, which blocked asylum access for most seekers, contributed to a decrease in people coming to the border. This finding is supported by immigration experts who agree that the Trump policy was one of a kind and had a significant impact on the flow of immigration.\n\nAdditionally, the Bipartisan Policy Center's senior adviser for immigration and border policy, Theresa Cardinal Brown, stated that migrants and migrant smugglers have proven highly adaptable to changes in policy, process, operations, and even infrastructure.

This means that any changes in immigration numbers may not be sustained over time, as migrants will adjust their routes and methods to circumvent new policies. This is evident in the fact that \"we have not seen sustained decreases in arrivals after policy changes in the past.\"\n\nSecondly, the data used to support the claim is based on encounters, not admissions. This is a crucial distinction, as encounters represent events, not individuals. It's difficult to know precisely how many people attempted to come into the country, as some may have been turned back or intercepted at the border. This lack of clarity makes it challenging to accurately assess the effectiveness of immigration policies.\n\nThirdly, the data does not reflect the changing demographics and nationalities of people arriving at the border, nor the factors driving them to migrate.

The opposition's attempts to distort the truth and cherry-pick evidence do not support the claim that Gallego wanted to defund the police."

According to the evidence, the continuing resolution includes a provision that would increase the salaries of most rank-and-file Congress members from $174,000 to $243,000 per year. This is a significant increase of $6,600, which would bring their total salary to $180,600.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service confirms that most congressional members receive an annual salary of $174,000. This information is crucial in establishing the baseline salary that would be increased under the proposed plan. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, has found that the Build Back Better bill would raise taxes by roughly $1.27 trillion over 10 years. This evidence highlights the financial implications of the proposed pay increase.\n\nFurthermore, the Department of Government Efficiency's claim that the proposed raises would be inflated by more than $60,000 is refuted by the actual figures.

According to the order, the policy of the United States is to recognize only two sexes: male and female. This definition is based on the ability to produce sperm and eggs, rather than chromosomes or genitalia.\n\nThis redefinition of sex is a significant change from the previous understanding, which recognized a broader range of gender identities. The new definition is intended to apply to the interpretation and enforcement of federal law and policy, although it does not affect state laws.\n\nSome critics have argued that this definition does not classify every single person in America as female, as it still recognizes the existence of males. However, I would argue that this definition effectively erases the existence of non-binary individuals, genderqueer individuals, and individuals who do not identify as male or female.\n\nFurthermore, the order's focus on the ability to produce sperm and eggs as the defining characteristic of sex is problematic, as it ignores the experiences and identities of individuals who do not fit into this binary framework.

While it is true that the order recognizes two sexes, male and female, as the policy of the United States, this does not necessarily mean that every single person in America is not legally classified as female. In fact, the order's language is intentionally vague and open-ended, leaving room for interpretation and enforcement at the discretion of federal agencies and courts.\n\nSecondly, my opponent's argument ignores the broader implications of the executive order.

In fact, President Trump did not end any Obama-era hiring protocols, and President Biden did not reinstate them.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that President Biden's administration made changes to the hiring process, but these changes were not a reversal of any Obama-era policies. The administration's actions were aimed at improving the hiring process and ensuring that air traffic controllers are qualified and competent.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that President Trump changed the Obama policy on hiring air traffic controllers and that President Biden came in and changed it is FALSE. The evidence presented in this debate shows that President Trump did not change any Obama-era policies, and President Biden's administration made changes to the hiring process that were aimed at improving the system, not reversing any previous policies.",
    "final_verdict": "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence presented does not support the claim that Trump changed the Obama policy on hiring air traffic controllers. The evidence suggests that Trump ended a hiring assessment for air traffic controllers launched by the Obama administration in 2014, but Biden did not reinstate it. Additionally, the evidence does not provide any evidence of a connection between the hiring policies and the fatal crash. The claim is misleading and does not accurately reflect the changes made by both presidents."

According to the evidence provided, Mace's office, a reputable source, states that \"barring chromosomal abnormalities, a person with a typical number of chromosomes \u2014 known as a euploid \u2014 has either XX or XY which determines biological sex.\" This statement highlights the fundamental importance of chromosomes in determining biological sex.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that most people are born with either XX chromosomes (female) or XY chromosomes (male).

For example, individuals with XXY chromosomes may be assigned male at birth but have anatomy that is affected by the additional female chromosome. Similarly, individuals with XYY chromosomes may have male chromosomes but not respond to their body's naturally produced male hormones, resulting in ambiguous sex characteristics.\n\nMoreover, the evidence mentions intersex conditions, which are characterized by the presence of both male and female reproductive organs or chromosomes.

Moreover, the opponent fails to provide any concrete evidence that Trump's policies have had a significant impact on military recruitment.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's claim that the Trump administration's efforts to rid the government of \"wokeness\" have led to an increase in recruitment is unfounded. There is no empirical evidence to support this claim, and it is unclear what specific policies or actions the administration has taken to achieve this goal.\n\nIn conclusion, while the U.S. Army may have had its single best recruiting month in 15 years in January, this achievement is not solely due to Trump's policies. The trend of excellent recruiting results predates Trump's presidency, and the factors contributing to the surge in",
    "pro_closing": "I'd be happy to summarize my final position.\n\nAs the supporting agent, I firmly believe that the claim \"All armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever\u201d because of Trump policies is TRUE. The evidence presented shows that the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years in January, and all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. This is a significant improvement from just a few months ago when the results were the opposite.\n\nPresident Trump himself has stated that the military recruitment is soaring early in his second presidency, and it's because of his efforts to rid the government of \"wokeness.\" Additionally, the data shows that recruitment is up, and it's been going up for months, well before Trump took office. This suggests that Trump's policies have had a positive impact on military recruitment.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence highlights that the military is on track to meet or exceed its recruitment goals, and the trend continued during the first four months of the 2025 fiscal year. This demonstrates that Trump's policies have had a lasting impact on military recruitment.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented clearly shows that Trump's policies have led to the best recruiting results ever in the history of our armed services. His efforts to rid the government of \"wokeness\" and his commitment to supporting the military have had a positive impact on recruitment, leading to a significant increase in enlistment numbers. Therefore, I firmly believe that the claim is",
    "con_closing": "I'd like to summarize my final position: The claim that \"All armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever\u201d because of Trump policies is HALF-TRUE.\n\nWhile it is true that the military has seen an increase in recruitment, the evidence suggests that this trend began before Trump took office. The Army's best recruiting month in 15 years was in late August 2024, months before the election. Additionally, military experts attribute the increase in recruitment to various factors, including the civilian economy and military recruitment programs, rather than solely to Trump's policies.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that Trump's efforts to \"rid the government of 'wokeness'\" have contributed to the increase in recruitment is unsubstantiated and lacks concrete evidence. The testimony of experts and the data provided do not support this claim.\n\nIn conclusion, while the military has seen an increase in recruitment, it is not entirely accurate to attribute this to Trump's policies. The evidence suggests that the trend began before his presidency and is influenced by a range of factors. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE.",
