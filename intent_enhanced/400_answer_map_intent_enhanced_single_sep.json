The evidence shows that Simpkins was released from jail on October 7, 2021, after paying a $75,000 bond, and his case is pending with a court date scheduled for December 10, 2021. Rittenhouse, on the other hand, was released from jail on November 20, 2020, on $2 million bail, and was found not guilty on all charges on the jury's fourth day of deliberations. The claim is partially true, as Simpkins did get a relatively lenient sentence compared to Rittenhouse, but the claim is also misleading as it implies that Rittenhouse was in jail for 2 months, which is not accurate. Additionally, the claim does not provide context about the severity of the crimes committed by both individuals, which could affect the severity of their sentences.

While it is true that Medicare Part B premiums have increased, the evidence suggests that the main drivers of inflation are complex and multifaceted, involving factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and global events like the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The claim oversimplifies the issue by attributing the increase in Medicare Part B premiums solely to Biden's policies, which is not supported by the evidence. Additionally, the evidence suggests that Medicare is largely immune to inflation due to its pricing mechanisms, and that the program's funding changes under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act may not be the primary cause of the premium increase. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is also misleading and oversimplifies the complex issue of inflation."

According to the evidence, the national debt has been high in the past, such as during World War II. Additionally, the claim that \"so much borrowing will be needed\" is also an exaggeration, as the government has borrowed money in the past to finance its activities.

According to the evidence, the estimated federal funding would be between $5 billion and $6 billion annually, which is significantly lower than the claimed $100 billion.

According to the evidence, 30% of fourth-graders in Texas are at or above the \"proficient\" level, which means that 70% are below. However, this does not necessarily mean that 7 out of 10 students cannot read at grade level.

The data shows that the fully vaccinated are at a lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes and death compared to the unvaccinated. However, the claim's statement that the fully vaccinated account for 4 in every 5 Covid deaths is not supported by the evidence. According to the CDC's COVID Data Tracker, unvaccinated people had 10 times the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 and 20 times the risk of dying from COVID-19 compared to people who were fully vaccinated with additional or booster doses.

While there are some reports of athletes experiencing cardiac issues or even death, these cases are not conclusively linked to the COVID-19 vaccination. Many of the reports are anecdotal, and multiple sports cardiologists have called the claims unfounded. Additionally, there is no official evidence linking the vaccines to heart issues in athletes.

The evidence provided does not support this claim. While there are some conspiracy theories and misinformation spread through social media, reputable government agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, and the FDA have debunked the chemtrails conspiracy theory, stating that it is not real and that there is no evidence to support the claim. Additionally, the Biological Threat Reduction Program between the U.S. and Ukraine is focused on reducing the threats posed by pathogens, not spraying toxic chemicals into the air.

The evidence provided does support the claim that there was a 300% increase in miscarriages, as well as almost 300% in cancer diagnoses. However, the evidence does not provide a clear and reliable source for the 1,000% increase in neurological issues. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the increase in miscarriages and cancer diagnoses may be due to underreported data from previous years, rather than a sudden and significant increase in 2021.

The Constitution is clear that the joint session's purpose is to count the electoral votes, not pass legislation. Additionally, Democratic cooperation in both chambers would have been needed to pass any changes to the law, which would have faced enormous legal and practical obstacles. Furthermore, Pence himself rejected any legal interpretation that suggested he had the power to accept alternate slates of electors.

The court ruling only struck down the 2019 change to the state's mail-in voting rules, which did not impact the 2020 election.

The data shows that the total installed capacity increased from 102,874 megawatts in winter 2020 to 118,257 megawatts in winter 2021, which represents a 15% increase.

Additionally, multiple sources, including Ira Stoll, the author of a book about Kennedy's economic policies, and Nicholas F. Jacobs, an assistant professor of government, have found no evidence to support the claim that Kennedy was planning to end the Federal Reserve.

This is indeed a way to \"get back at\" GoFundMe, as the company would have to cover the chargeback fees. However, the evidence also suggests that this strategy is not a guaranteed way to achieve the intended outcome, as companies have systems in place to defend against chargeback abuse. Additionally, GoFundMe ultimately changed its plans and decided to automatically refund all contributions directly, which may have mitigated the impact of the chargeback efforts. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true, but it is also not entirely false."

For example, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the unaccompanied children's program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which suggests that there is some level of oversight and vetting in place. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the process is not entirely opaque, as there are reports and data available on the number of children who have been processed and the conditions in which they are held. However, it is also true that the process has faced criticism and controversy, and some have argued that it is not transparent enough. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The evidence mentions that some out-of-pocket limits may still apply, and experts note that there are still other forms of coverage that are not subject to the $2,000 cap. Additionally, the evidence highlights that the law does not eliminate all surprise bills, as some bills may still arise from nonemergency hospitalizations or surgeries at in-network facilities with out-of-network providers. Therefore, while the law aims to reduce the number of surprise medical bills, it does not eliminate the possibility entirely, making the claim HALF-TRUE."

While it is true that the global economies did shut down and reopen simultaneously due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the evidence suggests that this is not the sole cause of inflation. The Federal Reserve analysis and most economists agree that global supply chain problems, changes in spending patterns, and the American Rescue Plan also contributed to the rise in inflation. Additionally, the U.S. economy's rapid growth is not the only reason for its high inflation rate, as other factors such as supply chain shortages, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and changes in consumer behavior also played a role. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is partially accurate but oversimplifies the complex factors contributing to inflation."

While it is true that the pipeline would have had the capacity to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day, it is not clear that it would have actually produced that amount. The evidence suggests that the pipeline would have required years of construction and likely faced legal challenges, which would have made it uncertain whether it could have produced a net increase of that number of barrels per day. Additionally, the pipeline would have only transported oil from Canada that is currently being transported some other way, and producers would not have been obligated to sell that entire amount to the US.

The claim implies that the US was producing oil at $27 a barrel two years ago, which is not supported by the evidence. According to the evidence, the average price of oil in 2001 was around $23 a barrel, and it has fluctuated over the years due to various factors such as global demand, supply disruptions, and pandemics. The evidence also suggests that the US has been producing more oil under Biden's administration, but the price of oil is influenced by global market forces, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, rather than solely due to Biden's policies.

The claim also mentions that Exxon, Chevron, BP, and Shell profits are at their highest level in over 7 years, which is true. However, the claim's focus on Russia's oil imports is misleading, as the U.S. has been importing oil from Russia for decades, and the recent increase in imports is not as steep as the claim suggests.

However, it did contribute to a global oil supply shortage, which led to higher prices and increased dependence on foreign oil, including Russian oil. The claim is exaggerated and misleading, as it implies a direct causal link between the pipeline cancellation and increased dependence on Russian oil, which is not supported by the evidence.

Wade, which protects the right to abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, typically around 24 weeks of gestation. Additionally, the evidence does not provide any quotes or statements from Jackson that suggest she believes in abortion on demand up to the moment of birth.

In fact, the evidence suggests that many ICE detainees are not seen within 24 hours and may even be told to wait until they are released to receive medical care. On the other hand, veterans are generally seen within a shorter timeframe than 24 hours, as the Department of Veterans Affairs has a mandate to provide timely medical care to veterans.

Specifically, polling experts have questioned the wording of the questions and the lack of knowledge among respondents about the policy.

Additionally, Mandel did oppose a bill that aimed to hold China accountable for currency manipulation, citing a preference for diplomatic means to address the issue. However, the claim's phrasing is misleading, as it implies a direct connection between Mandel's actions as treasurer and his opposition to the bill, which is not supported by the evidence. The claim is also exaggerated, as it implies that Mandel's actions as treasurer were motivated by a desire to benefit Chinese business interests, which is not supported by the evidence.

Additionally, the protest was held near a road that leads to Disney Springs, a shopping and entertainment district that visitors can access without a ticket.

While it is true that ATAGI did advise that vaccines may be administered opportunistically while patients are undergoing sedation for unrelated procedures, the evidence suggests that this is not being done as a measure to enforce compliance with vaccination requirements. Patient consent is still required, and the intention is to provide vaccination to patients who may have difficulty receiving the vaccine otherwise due to anxiety or needle phobia. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is accurate that vaccines may be administered under sedation, but it is inaccurate that this is being done as a way to force compliance."

While acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, is indeed a leading cause of acute liver failure, it is not the #1 cause of acute liver failure in the US. According to the evidence, acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause of acute liver injury and acute liver failure in the developed world, but the claim that it kills at least 100,000 people per year is an exaggeration. Additionally, the claim that 27% of people die from Tylenol use is also an exaggeration, as the actual number of cases of acute liver failure is relatively rare, with about 1,600 to 2,000 cases occurring in the US each year. The claim is also misleading because it implies that Tylenol itself is the cause of acute liver failure, when in fact it is the misuse or overdose of the medication that can lead to this condition. Overall, the claim is an exaggeration and a simplification of the complex relationship between acetaminophen and acute liver failure."

The evidence also shows that the definition of \"living paycheck to paycheck\" can be subjective and dependent on individual circumstances.

While it is true that the national debt increased by about $10 trillion during Perdue's tenure as a one-term U.S. senator, from 2015 to 2021, much of that was a bipartisan effort, not solely the work of \"liberals\". Additionally, the claim that Perdue's spending is driving inflation through the roof is an exaggeration, as inflation has multiple causes and some experts point to spending approved after Perdue left office as a key cause. The claim also relies on a misleading characterization of the debt, as much of the accumulated debt every year isn't even voted on; it essentially adds up from spending that's on autopilot.

The evidence also suggests that while corporate profits are high, it is not the sole cause of inflation, and that other factors such as supply chain pressures and household cost-of-living pressures are also contributing to the rise in prices. Therefore, the claim is half-true as it is accurate that the meat packers are experiencing record profits, but the reason for this is more complex and multifaceted than simply \"raking in\" profits."

    "**VERDICT**: HALF-TRUE  \n**REASON**: The claim \"When you have unemployment below 4% and inflation above 4%, recession always follows within two years\" is partially true, but not entirely accurate. The evidence provided shows that there is only one clear example of Summers' rule holding - a two-year period in 1968 and 1969 when unemployment was under 4% and inflation was above 4%, which came in the immediate run-up to a recession. However, the evidence also shows that there are not many instances of unemployment being below 4% and inflation being above 4% simultaneously, and that other factors can negate the correlation between high unemployment and low inflation (and vice versa). Additionally, the current situation with unemployment at 3.6% and inflation at 8.6% does not necessarily mean that a recession will follow within two years.

The claim implies that the majority of citizens will not experience any change, which is not entirely accurate. The overturning of Roe v.

The evidence shows that the US is not the only developed nation with restrictive abortion laws, and some countries have more restrictive laws than the US. However, the US is one of the few developed nations without a national right to abortion, which is a significant difference.

The evidence does mention that food costs increased at a rate of 10.4% during a certain time period, but it does not provide a specific percentage increase for the Fourth of July cookout.

Instead, it requires public colleges and universities to conduct an annual assessment of intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity, using a survey developed by the State Board of Education or the Board of Governors. This assessment is intended to ensure that students and faculty are free to discuss ideas and weigh them against one another, without being forced to adopt a particular ideology.

The evidence suggests that gender-affirming care is based on individual needs and goals, and that social support is the only type of gender-affirming care recommended for children before puberty. Additionally, while there may not be long-term studies on the effects of all gender-affirming medical interventions, there are studies that demonstrate the long-term efficacy and positive impacts of gender-affirming care, such as puberty blockers, on transgender youth.

The evidence also suggests that the state's budget situation has improved significantly over the years, with a projected surplus approaching 7 billion. However, some of the evidence also suggests that the surplus is partly due to factors outside of the Republicans' control, such as increased tax collections.

However, the evidence also suggests that the use of Title 42, a policy that allows the U.S. to expel migrants without allowing them to seek asylum, likely had an impact on the numbers.

While it is true that Social Security is a self-funded program primarily funded through payroll taxes, it does contribute to the unified budget deficit. According to the evidence, when Social Security draws down its assets to pay benefits to baby boomer retirees, it contributes to the unified budget deficit. Additionally, the program's trust fund is expected to be depleted by 2033, which could lead to a reduction in benefits or an increase in the deficit. However, it is also true that Social Security's funding is separate from the general fund and that the program's surpluses in the past have been used to reduce the national debt.

Additionally, the bill explicitly stated that the removal of historical figures from state code could not be used as a reason for the State Board of Education to remove them from state curriculum.

According to the evidence, there is an initial check of people's incomes to ensure they fit within the program's requirements before they can enroll in BadgerCare. Additionally, the program's eligibility is based on income level, and individuals with higher incomes may not qualify for the program.

Some states require same-day registrants to sign an oath attesting that they're providing accurate information, and voters who provide false information or commit fraud are subject to criminal charges. Additionally, same-day registration allows election officials to directly interact with people who have their relevant documents in hand, which can facilitate verification.

However, these reports are anecdotal and have not been scientifically proven to be caused by COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe claim is also misleading because it implies a direct causal link between COVID-19 vaccines and the development of cancer, which is not supported by scientific evidence. The spike protein produced by COVID-19 vaccines is harmless and is broken down by the body shortly after injection. Additionally, the vaccines do not contain the actual COVID-19 virus, which is the primary cause of cancer.\n\nFurthermore, the claim lacks context, as it does not provide information about the underlying causes of the reported cases of cancer or the potential confounding factors that may be contributing to the observed trends.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim is partially true, but the context and magnitude of the statement are exaggerated. The claim states that 300 gallons of jet fuel are burned to de-ice a wind turbine that needs 80 gallons of synthetic oil to operate. However, the evidence suggests that the claim is an exaggeration. The actual amount of fuel used for de-icing is not specified, and the claim about the turbine needing 80 gallons of synthetic oil derived from 12,000 gallons of crude oil to operate is unfounded. Additionally, the claim implies that the turbine is not operational without de-icing, which is not accurate. While wind turbines do require some energy to operate, they can continue to generate electricity even without de-icing. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it contains some accurate information, but the context and magnitude are exaggerated."

While the Trump administration did implement a policy that restricted transgender individuals from serving in the military, it was not a complete ban. The policy prohibited individuals with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria or those who required substantial medical treatment, including medicines and surgery, from serving in the military. However, it did not ban all transgender individuals from serving. Additionally, the policy allowed active transgender members to serve openly if they received a gender dysphoria diagnosis before April 2019. The policy was later rescinded by President Joe Biden in 2021. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also omits important details and context."

While Walgreens' statement does indeed say this, the evidence suggests that the company is not actually dispensing Mifepristone in all jurisdictions where it is legally permissible. Specifically, Walgreens is not dispensing Mifepristone in 17 of the 21 states with laws restricting abortion, even though it is legally permissible to do so in those states. This suggests that Walgreens' actions do not fully align with its stated position. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

This is partially true. According to the evidence, visiting players do pay income tax on their salaries when they play in Wisconsin, and this income tax would normally go to the state. However, the evidence also suggests that the state is considering using this income tax revenue to fund stadium upgrades for the Brewers, rather than allowing it to go to the state's general fund. Therefore, if the Brewers were to leave Wisconsin, the state would not necessarily lose out on this revenue, as it would be redirected to fund the stadium. The claim is half-true because it is accurate that visiting players pay income tax on their salaries in Wisconsin, but it is misleading to suggest that this revenue would disappear if the Brewers were to leave the state."

According to the evidence, in 2022, 52% of felony cases that survived review were downgraded to a misdemeanor, and in 2023, 54% of felonies have been downgraded to misdemeanors.

Tuberville's office has clarified that he does not object to existing federal statute and longstanding Defense Department policy that provides for abortion in narrow circumstances, and that his objection is specifically related to the new policy.

While it is true that the 1960s saw a significant shift away from institutionalization, the evidence suggests that the process began earlier, in the 1950s, and was driven by a combination of factors, including the development of antipsychotic medications, changes in public opinion, and fiscal concerns. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the shift was not solely the result of liberal policies, but rather a broader coalition of stakeholders, including conservatives, who sought to reform the mental health care system. The claim's focus on the 1960s as the sole period of deinstitutionalization is also inaccurate, as the process continued throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and beyond.

Additionally, the bill's language does not exempt veterans' programs from the overall spending reductions, which could result in cuts to these programs. However, the claim is also partially false because the bill does not specifically target veterans' programs for cuts, and the House GOP leadership has promised to protect these programs.

However, the evidence also highlights that not every district offers pre-K programs, and some districts have limited seats. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that not every 4-year-old is eligible for public preschool.

The evidence suggests that Wisconsin has been a swing state, with both parties having had success in different elections and time periods.

The claim is half-true because it is true that many teenage girls did contemplate suicide, but the claim's assertion that this is directly caused by having biological boys in locker rooms is unsupported by the evidence.

According to the evidence, the city of Milwaukee announced the five in-person voting centers on April 3, 2020, which is more than 4 days before the election on April 7, 2020. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the reduction was due to a severe shortage of poll workers, which was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing litigation and executive orders.

The evidence provided suggests that heat-related deaths do occur, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 8,081 people died in the United States from heat-related deaths from 1999 to 2010, which translates to 600 to 700 Americans per year. However, the evidence also highlights the difficulty in attributing deaths to heat, as many heat-related deaths may not be officially recorded as such. Additionally, the National Weather Service statistics show that the number of deaths from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes averaged 194 per year from 1986 to 2022, which is lower than the number of heat-related deaths. Nevertheless, heat deaths exceeded the combination of deaths from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes in 11 of the past 36 years.

For example, some of the evidence mentions the importance of following legal processes and procedures in challenging election results, and the need for evidence-based claims rather than unfounded accusations.

While the US has made significant progress in increasing its energy production and reducing its reliance on foreign oil, it is not entirely accurate to say that the country has achieved energy independence in just three years. The evidence suggests that the US still relies on imported oil and refined products, and its energy supply is still sensitive to international events. Additionally, the claim glosses over the fact that the US has been working towards energy independence for more than a decade, and that the progress made in the past three years is part of a longer-term trend.

The evidence suggests that the Biden administration did not directly add 20 million ineligible people to Medicaid. Instead, the administration extended the public health emergency, which allowed people to remain eligible for Medicaid, and urged states to slow down their reviews to avoid incorrectly disqualifying would-be Medicaid recipients. Additionally, the administration gave states an easier pathway and some federal funding for Medicaid expansion, which may have contributed to an increase in enrollment. However, it is unclear how many people will ultimately be removed from Medicaid rolls as states reevaluate their eligibility. The claim's implication that Biden directly added 20 million ineligible people to Medicaid is inaccurate and oversimplified.

However, it is also true that the unfrozen Iranian oil money could indirectly benefit Hamas, as the money is fungible. Additionally, some critics argue that the Biden administration's negotiation with Iran could have indirectly funded the attack on Israel.

While it is true that Biden has taken steps to increase legal immigration and provide temporary legal status to certain groups, such as Haitians and Venezuelans, there is no evidence to suggest that his goal is to create a permanent majority or that he is intentionally trying to increase illegal immigration. In fact, the evidence suggests that Biden has taken steps to strengthen border security and address the root causes of migration, such as natural disasters and economic or political turmoil in a person's home country. Additionally, the evidence shows that immigrants who arrive illegally have higher hurdles to clear before becoming citizens and voting, and that the Biden administration has not made any statements suggesting that they will vote for Democrats.

Unbranded generic drugs are an outlier and are typically cheaper in the U.S. compared to other countries. However, brand-name drugs are often significantly more expensive in the U.S. compared to other countries, with prices averaging 4.22 times higher. Therefore, the claim is only half-true, as it is not accurate to say that you can get any prescription filled for 40% to 60% less than it costs in the U.S. anywhere in the world.

While it is true that the government did take actions to regulate the distribution of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic, the evidence suggests that these actions were primarily aimed at preventing the misuse of these drugs for off-label uses, rather than stopping their distribution altogether. In contrast, the government has taken significant steps to address the fentanyl crisis, including increasing funding for fentanyl detection and interdiction efforts, as well as working with international partners to disrupt fentanyl supply chains. While the government has not taken identical actions to stop the distribution of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, it is not accurate to say that it did more to stop the distribution of these drugs than to stop the distribution of fentanyl.

However, the evidence also suggests that the claim may be an oversimplification, as the lakes' water levels can drop indefinitely if the water being removed exceeds the water coming in.

The evidence provided shows that there was a significant increase in layoffs, but it is not 100%. The article from WKOW states that layoffs are up 109% in January, which is a higher percentage than 100%. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the increase in layoffs is part of a larger trend of economic struggles, including high turnover rates, ballooning caseloads, and shortages. However, the exact percentage of increase in layoffs is not specified, so it cannot be definitively stated as 100%. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The evidence suggests that the highest number of removals and returns was in fiscal year 2019, under the Trump administration, and that the current numbers are still below that. However, the claim is also accurate in the sense that the number of removals and returns has increased, and Mayorkas' statement is technically correct if one focuses on the specific metrics he mentioned.

As the evidence suggests, many people who cross the border illegally cannot be immediately deported due to immigration law, congressional appropriations, and foreign policy. Additionally, the Biden administration has taken steps to increase immigration enforcement and has implemented policies that aim to deter cartels and coyotes. Therefore, while Biden's executive orders have changed the landscape of immigration policy, it is not accurate to say that he has implemented a policy that grants immunity to illegal aliens."

Additionally, the evidence shows that immigrants in the country illegally are not eligible for most federal programs, including unemployment benefits, and that they may be eligible for assistance deemed necessary to protect life or guarantee safety in dire situations.

However, the claim is exaggerated, as it implies that 12 elections in 24 years were decided by less than 30,000 votes, which is not supported by the evidence.

Some evidence suggests that this practice is becoming increasingly common, but it is not a universally adopted standard. Additionally, there is no evidence that this practice is specifically necessary in all situations, and some evidence suggests that other measures, such as Narcan, are also used to mitigate the risk of exposure.

However, the evidence also suggests that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that other provisions in the law will cost the government more money, reducing the total amount saved by about $44 billion over the next decade.

The evidence suggests that officials were concerned about the potential for crowds and traffic issues, which could lead to difficulties accessing essential supplies.

Additionally, the evidence suggests that the native-born employment level has declined for each of the last three months, but the increase during Biden's tenure has been substantial.

However, the majority of ByteDance's shares are owned by global investors, and the company is headquartered in the Cayman Islands, which suggests that it is not directly controlled by the Chinese government. Additionally, ByteDance has provided disclosures to Washington, D.C. courts, funders, and Chinese government documents, which show that 60% of TikTok is owned by global investors.

Much like what is done in communist countries.\" However, the evidence suggests that the situation is not comparable to seizures in communist countries. The civil fraud case against Trump is based on a judge's ruling that Trump and his business committed fraud by falsely inflating the value of his assets, and the potential property seizure is a consequence of that ruling. This is not the same as the actions of communist dictators, who often seize property without due process or compensation. While the claim is partially true in the sense that the property seizure is a form of taking, it is not accurate to compare it to communist countries where property seizures are often arbitrary and without legal basis.

The White House has not provided any evidence to suggest that the President intentionally chose Easter Sunday to mark the occasion.

There is no mention of mandating abortion until the moment of birth.

The evidence suggests that the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. is around 11-12 million, which is significantly lower than the claimed range of 20-30 million. The claim is exaggerated and lacks credible evidence to support the higher numbers. The evidence provided by demographers and think tanks, such as the Center for Migration Studies and the Migration Policy Institute, estimates the number of unauthorized immigrants to be around 11-12 million, which is consistent with the data on border apprehensions and other indicators.

We did not have any accountability for what was going on there, and we should have.\" This statement is a general expression of responsibility, rather than a specific admission of responsibility for not having the National Guard. Additionally, Pelosi's spokesperson has clarified that she did not have the authority to deploy the National Guard and that no request was made for the National Guard before Jan. 6.

While it is true that Trump did not directly send the National Guard to Kenosha, the evidence suggests that the governor, Tony Evers, did take steps to deploy the National Guard, including declaring a state of emergency and increasing the number of troops. However, the evidence also suggests that the governor's efforts were not sufficient to prevent the violence and destruction that occurred in Kenosha. Therefore, the claim that Trump \"saved Kenosha\" is exaggerated and not entirely accurate. The claim that the governor \"wouldn't move\" on sending the National Guard is also partially true, as there is evidence that the governor was slow to respond to the situation and that the National Guard was not deployed until after Trump had spoken with Wisconsin officials. However, the claim that the governor did not take any action at all is not supported by the evidence. Overall, the claim is HALF-TRUE because it contains some elements of truth, but is also exaggerated and misleading."

However, the evidence also suggests that the decline was not as severe as a recession, and the pandemic itself had a significant impact on the manufacturing sector.

Additionally, Trump has also made statements indicating that he would not cut Social Security benefits, such as his 2024 campaign website statement saying \"DO NOT CUT the benefits our seniors worked for and paid for their entire lives.\" Therefore, while Trump's past statements and proposals raise concerns about his potential impact on Social Security, it is unclear whether he intends to cut Social Security benefits."

In Florida, immigrants in the country illegally are not eligible to vote, and having a driver's license does not make someone a U.S. citizen.\n2. The video shared on social media did not prove that the people in line were Somalis or immigrants illegally in the U.S.\n3. Joe Scott, the elections supervisor in Broward County, stated that \"You must be a U.S. citizen in order to vote\" and that having a Florida driver's license does not make someone a U.S. citizen.\n4. The evidence also highlights that cases of noncitizens voting are statistically rare and often result from misunderstandings or errors, and that most noncitizens do not want to risk drawing government authorities' attention by casting a ballot.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE, as it is not accurate to state that Somali immigrants illegally in the U.S. can vote by obtaining a driver's license in Pompano Beach, Florida."

This is a significant difference, but not exactly five times more likely. Additionally, the evidence also shows that the ratio of Minnesotans moving to Florida to Floridians moving to Minnesota has fluctuated over the years, and in 2022, the ratio was closer to 2:1.

Instead, the law enables Minnesota courts to hear custody cases and issue temporary custody orders in cases where a parent brings a child to Minnesota to seek gender-affirming care, which is a narrow and specific circumstance. The law does not automatically take children away from their parents if they don't consent to gender-affirming care. Additionally, the evidence shows that parental consent is still required for minors to access gender-affirming medical care in Minnesota, and the law does not change this requirement.

The ad was not a campaign ad, but rather a tribute to the military and fallen service members' families. The disclaimer at the start of the video also clarifies that the use of DoD visual information does not imply or constitute endorsement of the US military, any military personnel, or the Department of Defense.

While it is true that Haitian immigrants have moved to Springfield, Ohio, and that the prevalence of HIV and TB is higher in Haiti than in Ohio, the evidence does not support the claim that communicable disease rates have skyrocketed in Springfield.\n\nThe evidence provided shows that the rate of communicable diseases, excluding COVID-19 cases, has generally dropped since 2018 in Clark County, where Springfield is located. While there was a slight increase in 2022, the rate hit its lowest point since 2015 in 2023. This suggests that the claim of a \"skyrocketing\" increase in communicable diseases is exaggerated.\n\nHowever, it is also true that the influx of Haitian immigrants has put a strain on healthcare services in Springfield, leading to longer wait times for appointments.

For example, the U.S. has thousands of service members stationed in the Middle East, and some of these countries are in recognized combat zones. Additionally, there have been instances of U.S. service members being killed or injured while serving abroad, which suggests that they are still engaged in hostile environments.

Additionally, his campaign has gone back and forth on his position on the ACA, with some statements suggesting he wants to replace the law with an alternative. Therefore, it is not entirely accurate to say that Trump \"chose to build upon\" the ACA, as his actions and statements have been more focused on weakening or replacing the law rather than strengthening it. However, it is also not entirely false, as Trump did not repeal the law and some of his actions may have had unintended consequences that benefited the ACA. Therefore, the verdict is HALF-TRUE."

    "**VERDICT**: HALF-TRUE  \n**REASON**: The claim states that First Lady Jill Biden led a Cabinet meeting for President Joe Biden and her signature appears on presidential stationery. However, the evidence suggests that Jill Biden did not lead the meeting, but rather provided a scheduled update on her initiative for women's health research at the beginning of the meeting. Additionally, the presidential folder with the presidential seal and signatures from both Bidens is a ceremonial item given to attendees of White House events, not used for official purposes. Therefore, the claim is partially true, but the extent of Jill Biden's involvement in the meeting is exaggerated."

The removals were mostly due to ineligibility, and experts consider this a normal part of maintaining accurate voter rolls. While there have been instances of voter fraud in North Carolina, there is no evidence to suggest that the removals were done to influence the outcome of an election. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is partially accurate but also misleading and exaggerated."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Milwaukee is one of the sex trafficking capitals in our country\" is partially true. While there is evidence that sex trafficking is a significant problem in Milwaukee, the exact ranking of the city as a \"sex trafficking capital\" is difficult to measure due to the lack of accurate data and the varying definitions of what constitutes a \"sex trafficking capital\". The evidence provided shows that Milwaukee has a higher number of reported cases of child sex trafficking compared to other counties in Wisconsin, but it is not clear if this is due to the city being a hub for trafficking or if it is simply because more people are aware of the issue and reporting it. Additionally, the Milwaukee Police Department reports a relatively low number of human trafficking cases compared to other crimes. Therefore, while sex trafficking is a problem in Milwaukee, the claim that it is one of the \"sex trafficking capitals\" is an exaggeration and should be considered half-true."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"About 400,000 manufacturing jobs in the state of Michigan will go away with EV mandates\" is partially true, but not entirely accurate. The evidence suggests that some auto manufacturing jobs may be lost due to the transition to electric vehicles, but the exact number is disputed. The Ford CEO's statement mentioned in the evidence suggests that 400,000 jobs could be lost, but other sources, such as the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget, estimate that the number of auto manufacturing jobs in Michigan is less than half of that, around 175,000. Additionally, some experts argue that new jobs in EV production, such as battery manufacturing, may offset some of the job losses. Therefore, while the claim is not entirely false, it is also not entirely accurate, and a more nuanced assessment is needed to determine the actual impact of EV mandates on manufacturing jobs in Michigan."

He has also written that he will fight for increased price transparency and require health insurers to disclose their negotiated drug rebates and discounts. This suggests that Hovde does not entirely oppose efforts to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies, but rather wants to approach the issue in a different way. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

However, it is possible that the person may have received indirect communication or messages from the White House, which is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

The evidence suggests that there was a significant decrease in immigration during the Trump administration, with some sources stating that the number of migrants reaching the southern U.S. border had dropped by about 50%. However, the evidence also suggests that this decrease may not be sustained, as migrants and migrant smugglers have proven adaptable to changes in policy and infrastructure. Additionally, the data on immigration encounters is complex and difficult to interpret, making it challenging to determine the exact impact of policy changes on immigration flows. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is also incomplete and oversimplifies the complex issue of immigration."

Additionally, Gallego's campaign has consistently denied the claim, stating that he supports the police and has secured funding to hire more officers. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it contains an element of truth, but is also misleading and inaccurate."

According to USPS spokesperson Martha Johnson, the Postal Service has used the same procedures for previous general elections, and there is no credible evidence to support the claim of a recent change.

Instead, it defined a \"nonviolent\" felony based on what was already in California's penal code. The crimes Trump named were not on the preexisting list of violent felonies and were already considered not violent under California law.

The evidence also suggests that Brown has made comments about wanting to eliminate federal agencies with duplicate state agencies, which could potentially affect Medicaid, but it is not clear whether this would result in a direct cut to the program. Additionally, the evidence does not provide specific information about Brown's stance on Medicaid and Social Security, making it difficult to determine the extent to which he wants to cut these programs.

Instead, it shows a report by NBC News political and national correspondent Jacob Soboroff outside Philadelphia's election warehouse, where he mentions that 50,000 ballots would be released in the next nine minutes and then another 37,000 ballots the next day.

Thune's exact words were \"perhaps mandatory programs are areas that they\u2019re looking to make cuts in, like Social Security for example.\" This implies that Social Security might be considered for cuts, but it does not confirm that Thune has made a concrete plan to do so.

According to the evidence, the trucks went through a routine safety check with CAL Fire on January 9, and no emissions or smog testing was performed. Additionally, Cal Fire stated that no vehicles from out-of-state were turned around or refused service, and all out-of-state vehicles were serviced and headed to or had arrived in Southern California.

Biden did not reinstate the protocol, but instead made changes to the hiring process.

According to the evidence, FEMA did not give money directly to luxury hotels, but rather to New York City, which used the funds to house migrants. The money did not come from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, but rather from a separate program funded by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Additionally, the claim that the money was spent on \"high-end hotels\" is also false, as the evidence suggests that the funds were used to cover the cost of immediate emergency supplies and fuel for evacuations.

The actual number of workers affected by the cancellation is not specified in the evidence provided, and it is likely that the number of workers laid off was lower than 14,000.

While the Army did have its best recruiting month in 15 years in January, this was not necessarily due to Trump's policies, as the trend of improving recruitment had already begun before his presidency.
