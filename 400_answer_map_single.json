    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Donald Trump 'never changed one immigration law'\" is partially true. While Trump did not sign any major immigration law during his presidency, he did achieve some changes through executive orders and congressional appropriations bills. For example, he signed the first version of the travel ban, created the Migrant Protection Protocols, and restricted asylum access. Additionally, he achieved funding for some border wall construction. However, the claim is also partially false because Trump did not change any comprehensive immigration laws, and his executive actions were limited in scope and could be reversed by future administrations."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence provided does not support the claim that 75,000 acres of farmland in Ohio are being poured down with acid rain. While the evidence does mention acid rain and its potential effects, it does not provide any evidence to support the claim that acid rain is currently occurring in Ohio or affecting farmland. In fact, multiple sources, including the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and Ohio Department of Agriculture, have stated that there has been no acid rain in Ohio and that the train derailment has not caused acid rain to pour down on farmland. Additionally, experts have stated that the likelihood of producing a toxic acid rain is \"essentially nonexistent\" and that the chemicals released in the controlled burn would have been gone by the time light rain fell on February 8. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

Additionally, while the United States has reduced its reliance on coal energy, it is not the only country to do so. China has retired more coal-fired units than the United States, and many European Union countries have also reduced their coal capacity.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim that \"biological boys in their locker rooms\" is a reason why \"a third of our teenage girls seriously contemplated suicide last year\" is not supported by the evidence. Nikki Haley's statement is anecdotal and lacks scientific evidence to establish a causal link between the presence of transgender athletes in locker rooms and the suicidal ideation of teenage girls. The evidence presented suggests that suicidal ideation among teenage girls is a complex issue with multiple factors contributing to it, including poverty, childhood abuse, untreated mental illness, identifying as LGBTQ+, social consequences of the pandemic, and others. The Trevor Project's data shows that about half of transgender and nonbinary young people have seriously considered suicide in the past year, but this is not related to the presence of transgender athletes in locker rooms. The CDC survey found that teen girls were experiencing record high levels of suicide risk, but this was not attributed to the presence of transgender athletes. Experts in the field of teen suicide and related fields dismissed any connection tying exposure to trans girls in locker rooms to the suicidal thoughts of teen girls. The evidence presented does not support the claim that the presence of transgender athletes in locker rooms is a cause of suicidal ideation among teenage girls."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Democrats are \"asking for a blank check book to spend as much as they want without worrying about the repercussions\" is partially true. While it is true that Democrats have proposed increasing the debt ceiling to allow for continued spending, the notion that this is a \"blank check\" is a misconception. According to Iowa State University economics professor Joydeep Bhattacharya, the debt ceiling is the limit on how much the U.S. government can spend before getting authorization to spend again, and raising the debt ceiling does not authorize new spending. Instead, it allows for the government to continue spending on programs that have already been authorized. Additionally, new spending proposals must still go through Congress. Therefore, while Democrats are seeking to increase the debt ceiling to allow for continued spending, it is not a \"blank check\" that allows them to spend as much as they want without repercussions."

Additionally, the state has a supermajority of Republicans in its state Legislature and a Democrat in the governor's mansion, which suggests that the state is not entirely blue. The claim is also undermined by the fact that Wisconsin has a mix of Republican and Democratic leaders, and that the state's political landscape is more complex than a simple \"blue\" or \"red\" label.

According to the evidence, the national average retail gasoline price was $2.39 per gallon when Biden took office and rose to $3.53 per gallon when Chris Rose tweeted, which represents an increase of around 48%. The graph presented by Rose was outdated, showing prices from August 30, which was not the current price at the time of his tweet. The actual increase in gasoline prices on Biden's watch is around 45% or less, depending on the date considered.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim is partially true, but it is also misleading. The CDC study found that people with natural immunity from a previous COVID-19 infection were better protected against the delta variant than vaccinated people who had never been infected. However, the study had several limitations, including a limited sample size, and did not account for the severity of previous infections or deaths from the virus. Additionally, the study was conducted before the spread of the omicron variant, and the CDC has emphasized that vaccination is the safest form of protection against COVID-19, providing additional protection for people who have already been infected. The claim also ignores the fact that a previous COVID-19 infection does not guarantee that a person will not need medical care if they get the virus again. Overall, while the study suggests that natural immunity may provide some protection, it is not superior to vaccinated immunity alone, and vaccination is still the best way to prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death."

This decline is attributed to various factors, including the implementation of policies that limit immigrants' ability to apply for asylum, increased enforcement efforts by Mexico, and joint efforts to curb immigration, fentanyl, and firearms trafficking.

Mike Bost, the chair of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, made this statement, the evidence suggests that the House GOP debt-ceiling bill would indeed result in cuts to veterans' programs. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimated a 22% cut for fiscal year 2024 compared to 2023 funding, which could translate to 13 million fewer health care appointments for veterans and significant cuts to benefit payments, staffing, and clinic construction. However, it is also true that the bill does not explicitly exempt veterans' programs from cuts, and the House GOP leadership has promised to spare programs that are popular with Republican voters, such as the defense budget and veterans' health services.

In fact, the evidence shows that millions of migrants were detained and deported during Biden's presidency, and the number of migrants detained has remained relatively consistent with previous administrations.

Instead, it adds \"a parent's affirmation of the child's gender identity\" as one of the factors that judges must consider when determining what is in the child's best interest in custody disputes.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) cited three main factors for the increase: rising health care costs, a move by Congress last year that held the premium increase to just $3 a month because of the pandemic, and the need to raise money for a possible unprecedented surge in drug costs. Inflation was not on that list. Additionally, Medicare is largely immune from inflation because the program sets prices for hospitals and doctors.

However, the evidence provided shows that Illinois received $5.1 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan, but it was not allocated to a single elementary school. Instead, the majority of the funding was split among the state's roughly 850 school districts. Additionally, the funding was not used solely for equity and diversity, but rather for a variety of purposes, including helping groups of students who were disproportionately affected by the pandemic, such as low-income students, and for tutoring, after-school programs, and special education.

While it is true that Wisconsin does not ask people about their income level to qualify for BadgerCare, it is not entirely accurate to say that people can be multimillionaires and still get BadgerCare benefits. According to the evidence, there is an initial check of people's incomes to ensure they fit within the program's requirements before they can enroll in BadgerCare. Additionally, there are external checks to ensure that people's incomes remain below the threshold, and people are required to report any changes in income that could disqualify them from receiving benefits.

Additionally, DeSantis has consistently opposed comprehensive immigration reform and has spoken publicly against a path to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally.

While the city did not reduce police funding to reallocate it to non-policing forms of public safety and community support, as defined by the Wikipedia definition of \"defund the police,\" the city did make budget cuts and reductions in police positions. Specifically, the city cut 120 police positions in 2021 and reduced funding from $304 million in 2024 to $280 million in 2022. Additionally, the city has decreased the number of sworn officers from 1,864 in 2019 to 1,645 in 2024. However, the city has also increased funding for police in recent years, with the 2024 budget allocating $304 million, the highest level since 2018.

According to the Office for National Statistics, in England and Wales, there were 17,371 deaths where COVID-19 was the sole cause of death, while there were 131,641 deaths overall where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that the reported death toll is inflated, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that the reported death toll is accurate, and the difference between the two numbers is due to the fact that COVID-19 is often mentioned as a contributing factor to death, even if it was not the sole cause.

However, the claim is not entirely accurate because the savings are not immediate and will take several years to materialize. Additionally, not all of the savings will be permanent, as some will be funneled into related provisions that expand access and lower out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries.

While the Biden administration has implemented policies aimed at reducing fossil fuel production and use, such as suspending drilling and mining on Bureau of Land Management property and canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, these policies are not the sole cause of high gas prices. The evidence suggests that the main factors contributing to high gas prices are the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic and disruptions to global supply and demand. The article cites a report from the New York Times stating that gas prices have risen largely in response to the pandemic and the decrease in supply and increase in demand. Additionally, the article notes that gas prices were already rising before the Biden administration took office, and that the Keystone XL pipeline's cancellation would have had a minimal impact on global oil production.

While it is true that the pipeline would have had the capacity to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day, the evidence suggests that the US was already importing over 800,000 barrels per day from Russia in May 2021, and this figure had decreased to 595,000 by October 2021. Therefore, the claim is only half-true because it is based on a static figure of 830,000 barrels per day, without considering the actual import figures from Russia, which were already above that amount. Additionally, the claim implies that the pipeline would have solved the US's demand needs, which is not supported by the evidence, as the pipeline would have required years of construction and faced legal challenges, and even then, there would be no certainty that it would produce a net increase of 800,000 barrels a day."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: While Governor Ron DeSantis claims to have eliminated critical race theory (CRT) in Florida's K-12 schools, the evidence suggests that CRT was never a standard in Florida K-12 schools to begin with. Educators, school officials, and several Florida public school districts confirm that CRT was not taught in Florida's elementary, middle, or high schools. The Stop WOKE Act, signed into law by DeSantis, prohibits teaching that anyone \"must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress\" based on their race as a result of actions by others in the past, but this is not the same as eliminating CRT. The law also bans teaching that anyone is inherently racist or sexist because of their race or sex, which is a key tenet of CRT. Therefore, while DeSantis' claim is partially true in that CRT is not being taught in Florida's K-12 schools, it is also partially false in that CRT was never a standard in these schools to begin with, and the Stop WOKE Act is a broader prohibition on certain topics rather than a direct elimination of CRT."

This is close to the mark, but not exactly 50%. The evidence also highlights that the growth in tax receipts was driven by significant increases in personal income tax, corporate income tax, and sales tax, which account for 93% of the general fund's tax receipts. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is close to the actual growth rate but not exactly accurate."

Trump has repeatedly stated that he will not cut Social Security and has even posted a statement on his campaign website saying that he will not cut the benefits that seniors have worked for and paid for their entire lives. Additionally, his campaign has stated that he will continue to strongly protect Social Security and Medicare in his second term. However, Trump's past statements and actions, such as his flirtation with privatization and cuts to certain parts of the program, suggest that he may be open to making changes to Social Security in the future.

While it is true that Florida's water quality has not improved significantly under DeSantis' administration, the claim is also misleading because it does not provide a clear definition of \"dirtier and sicker.\" The article states that the Florida Department of Environmental Protection reported that 2.5 million acres of estuaries were polluted in 2018, which decreased to 2.1 million in 2020, but increased to 3.1 million in 2022. Similarly, the number of impaired lakes and coastal waters also increased during DeSantis' tenure.

Additionally, the number of people who are ineligible for Medicaid is estimated to be much lower than 20 million, and it's not clear how many people will be removed from the program as states reevaluate their rolls. The claim is also based on a misunderstanding of the process of removing people from Medicaid, as it's not a simple matter of states \"taking people off\" the program. The evidence suggests that many people who were removed from Medicaid were removed for procedural reasons, not because they were no longer eligible."

The claim implies that Bragg has downgraded over 50% of all felonies, whereas the evidence only provides data on the percentage of felony cases that were downgraded, not the total number of felonies.

Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, it is not accurate to attribute the shift solely to \"liberals.\" The evidence suggests that a broad coalition of policymakers, including conservatives like Ronald Reagan, supported the deinstitutionalization of mental health care, driven by a combination of factors including the development of antipsychotic medications, the desire to reduce costs, and a growing recognition of the need for community-based care. While Kennedy and Johnson's policies did play a role in the deinstitutionalization process, it was not a single-party effort, and the claim that \"liberals emptied our psych wards\" is an inaccurate and misleading representation of the complex history of mental health care policy in the United States."

Additionally, the claim's statistics are exaggerated, as the actual number of deaths from acetaminophen overdose is significantly lower than 100,000 per year. While Tylenol does contain acetaminophen, it is not the only product that contains this ingredient, and the risk of liver damage is associated with taking excessive amounts of acetaminophen, not just Tylenol.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that David Perdue voted with liberals for $10 trillion in new debt is partially true. According to the evidence, Perdue did vote for large debt-raising measures, including the 2017 tax cut and the two COVID-19 relief bills. However, the claim that this debt was solely the result of Perdue's actions is false. The evidence shows that the debt increase was a bipartisan effort, and that much of the debt was accumulated through automatic spending on programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Additionally, the claim that Perdue's spending is driving inflation \"through the roof\" is also false. The evidence suggests that inflation has multiple causes, including global supply chain problems and changes in spending patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that Perdue's spending is only one factor among many. Overall, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also misleading and exaggerated."

The evidence provided does not support this claim. Elon Musk's statement is an opinion and not based on facts. The evidence shows that Biden does not support a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally, and the new Senate bill does not provide a path to citizenship for anyone currently in the country illegally. Additionally, it takes many years for immigrants to become U.S. citizens, and there is no guarantee that immigrants who gain citizenship will vote for Democrats. The claim is also contradicted by the fact that federal law requires citizenship as a condition to vote in national elections, and interacting with the government, including trying to vote, is something immigrants in the country illegally try to avoid."

The safety check did not hinder Oregon's assistance, and the equipment was cleared to continue fighting the fires.

Additionally, Kennedy supported legislation to reorganize the terms of the Federal Reserve, which would have taken effect after his first term would have ended, and the Congressional Research Service debunked common myths about the Federal Reserve, including the theory that Kennedy's purported desire to rein in the Federal Reserve led to his assassination.

Experts have pointed out that the context and motivations behind the seizure are different, and it is not a general move against private property.

The claim implies that the entire amount was spent on hiring SWAT members, which is not the case. The aid package was designed to sustain Ukraine for months, not to hire SWAT members for every school in the US. Additionally, the claim does not take into account the actual cost of hiring and training SWAT members, as well as the logistics of deploying them to every school. The claim is also misleading in that it implies that hiring SWAT members would be an effective solution to school safety, which is not supported by evidence.

However, the document does promote a traditional definition of marriage as between one man and one woman, and advocates for policies that support faith-based organizations that do not recognize same-sex marriage.

However, it's important to note that the study's equivalent scores do not evaluate how well students are learning, and experts stress that what Virginia considers proficient may not be at the same level as other states. Additionally, Virginia's eighth-grade math standards were not measured, and the state's students perform well on national exams in both math and reading.

The evidence shows that the state already collects income tax from visiting athletes, and this would continue regardless of whether the Brewers stay or leave. The claim is also misleading because it implies that the Brewers' presence is the sole source of these tax revenues, when in fact, the state collects taxes from athletes in all three top-level professional leagues that have teams in Wisconsin.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that \"Expanding Medicaid, which if we had done at the beginning of the Abbott administration, would have brought in $100 billion to this state's economy\" is partially true. The evidence suggests that the original estimate of $100 billion in federal funding for Medicaid expansion in Texas was based on a 2013 report by Billy Hamilton Consulting, which analyzed federal funding under scenarios of minimal, moderate, and high enrollment levels. The report estimated that Texas would receive nearly $100 billion in federal funding over a decade if it expanded Medicaid. However, more recent estimates suggest that the actual amount of federal funding Texas would receive if it expanded Medicaid is likely to be significantly lower, ranging from $5 billion to $6 billion annually. Therefore, while the claim is based on a valid estimate, it is not entirely accurate, and the actual amount of federal funding Texas would receive is likely to be lower than the original estimate."

According to the evidence, Biden was a presidential professor of practice at the University of Pennsylvania from 2017 to 2019, which is about two years, not four. Additionally, his role did not involve regular classroom teaching, but rather speaking events and other activities. While he did interact with students and share his insights with them, it was not a traditional teaching position.

According to the evidence, the protest was held on the sidewalk, and no roads were blocked, allowing visitors to still enter the property.

The study did not cite sexual intercourse as a possible source of the DNA.

The claim also relies on outdated and potentially misleading data, and the concept of \"living paycheck to paycheck\" is not well-defined.

A closer examination of the evidence shows that Fauci's guidance was nuanced and context-dependent, and that he was responding to the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic.

Additionally, his proposal to eliminate federal agencies with duplicate state agencies and move Medicaid management to the states could potentially lead to changes in the program, but it is unclear whether this would result in actual cuts.

According to the evidence, Baldwin was part of a group of four lawmakers who pushed House leadership to make the change, and a letter from former Rep. Henry Waxman credits her with drafting the idea. Additionally, the evidence states that the provision was included in the House version of the bill, but it was not until the House and Senate versions were merged that the provision became part of the final law. Therefore, while Baldwin played a role in the passage of the provision, it is not entirely accurate to say that she \"wrote the amendment.\" The second part of the claim, that millions of young Americans got health care overnight, is also exaggerated. While the provision did take effect quickly, the evidence suggests that it was a gradual process, with insurance companies having to make changes and parents having to notify their insurers or employers to add their children to their policies.

The Defense Department and experts confirm that US service members are serving in areas where hostile actions may occur, and there have been instances of US service members being killed or injured while serving abroad. Therefore, the claim is partially true, as it is accurate that the US is not engaged in a declared war, but it is misleading to suggest that no US service members are in active duty in a combat zone.

The evidence provided shows that there have been numerous instances of political violence in the United States throughout its history, including attempts on the lives of presidents, members of Congress, and other political leaders. Additionally, the evidence shows that political violence has been a persistent issue in the United States, with threats against members of Congress and election officials increasing over the years.

Additionally, the campaign included data from all of fiscal year 2009, despite Obama being president for only eight full months that year, and didn't include the four months in fiscal year 2021 that Trump was president.

However, the claim oversimplifies the progress towards energy independence, which has been a long-term effort spanning over a decade, and ignores the fact that the US still imports a significant amount of crude oil. Additionally, the definition of energy independence is not universally agreed upon, and some experts argue that the US has not truly achieved energy independence as long as it relies on imports to satisfy domestic demand for oil and refined products.

While the National Weather Service statistics show that the number of deaths from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes averaged 194 from 1986 to 2022, and the number of heat deaths was smaller, at about 137 per year over the past two decades, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data shows higher levels of deaths from heat. The CDC reports that from 1999 to 2010, 8,081 people died in the United States from heat-related deaths, which is 600 to 700 Americans per year. However, the CDC figures on heat deaths are likely an understatement, as many people die of heat-related deaths without heat being officially noted as a cause on their death certificate.

However, Trump did have a conversation with Evers on August 25, 2020, and the White House did offer federal troops from the Department of Homeland Security, which Evers accepted. Additionally, Trump's claim that he was responsible for sending the National Guard is exaggerated, as the process of activating the National Guard is typically handled by the governor, not the president. The governor-to-governor compact, as described by Maj. Gen. Paul Knapp, suggests that the White House's role was more advisory than decisive in the deployment of the National Guard.

The evidence suggests that there is no such plan or guideline from the Biden administration to limit Americans to two beers per week. The claim appears to be a misinterpretation of a statement made by Dr. George Koob, the director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, who mentioned that the US could revise its alcohol recommendation to match Canada's, where people are advised to limit themselves to two drinks per week. However, this is not a plan or guideline from the Biden administration, but rather a suggestion from a government official. Additionally, the White House spokesperson has explicitly denied the claim, stating that it is \"absolutely false\". Furthermore, PolitiFact found no reference to Biden calling for a limit on drinking. The claim is likely a political talking point used by Senator Ted Cruz to criticize the Biden administration."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Pennsylvania had 2.6 million mail-in votes that the court of appeals of PA held to be unconstitutional, and that this means Biden lost PA. However, the evidence shows that the court did not hold the votes to be unconstitutional, but rather the law that allowed no-excuse mail-in voting. The court's ruling did not affect the outcome of the election, as Biden still won Pennsylvania by about 80,000 votes. The claim is partially true in that the court did rule that the law was unconstitutional, but it is also misleading in its implication that this means Biden lost the state."

The National Guard is providing support due to the expected influx of visitors and the potential for overtaxing local resources, which is a common scenario for large events. The evidence does not provide any indication that the National Guard's involvement is unusual or indicative of something more significant. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The stimulus checks were only given to individuals with valid Social Security numbers, and immigrants in the country illegally were not eligible.

The program does not provide assistance to individuals who are in the U.S. illegally. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the program's eligibility criteria and the fact that some asylum seekers may have pending asylum applications.

The evidence shows that documents with lower classifications, such as confidential, can be stored and viewed in classified spaces that are not SCIFs. Additionally, experts have stated that even top-secret/sensitive compartmented information can be removed from a SCIF as long as proper protocols are followed. The claim is also contradicted by the fact that President Biden's lawyers gave the Justice Department access to search his Wilmington home, which suggests that classified documents can be taken out of a SCIF in certain circumstances.

However, polling experts have raised concerns about the methodology and wording of the question, which may have influenced the results.

While ByteDance is a privately-owned company, it has agreed to allow the Chinese government to take a 1% ownership stake in one of its China-based subsidiaries, Beijing Douyin Information Service Co., which operates an app similar to TikTok in China. This \"golden share\" gives the Chinese government a say in the company's operations and raises concerns about potential influence over ByteDance's global operations, including TikTok. However, the majority of ByteDance is owned by international investors, and the company has repeatedly denied that the Chinese government has any control over its operations or access to user data. The exact extent of the Chinese government's influence over ByteDance is unclear, and it is difficult to verify the company's ownership structure independently. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The articles and social media posts cited in the evidence do not provide credible evidence to support the claim of \"war prep\" or looming military action.

The CPSC is seeking more information and public comment on the risks associated with gas stoves, but no ban has been proposed or implemented. Additionally, the CPSC lacks the power to remove products already in consumers' homes, and any ban would apply to new products, not existing ones.

According to the evidence, Californians who meet certain income limits are also eligible for the program, and Assembly Bill 1840 would codify that an applicant's immigration status cannot be the sole reason for disqualification. Additionally, the bill would apply only to immigrants in the country illegally who have Social Security numbers or Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers, which includes DACA recipients.

Instead, the bill proposes a pilot program to test signature-verification software, and Section 48(d) specifically states that no executed mail-in absentee ballot shall be rejected by the county board of elections for failing any signature verification.

However, not all armed robberies would be downgraded to misdemeanors, only those that meet this specific criteria. Additionally, the claim that the DA is stopping prosecuting resisting arrest is also partially true, as Bragg's memo states that resisting arrest would not be prosecuted unless accompanied by another charge not included on the list of offenses the office was generally declining to prosecute. However, this is not a blanket policy of not prosecuting resisting arrest, but rather a nuanced approach that depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

He was unaware of these attempts because he was traveling and the White House staff member spoke with a member of his staff instead.

According to the evidence, the number of homicides in Aurora decreased from 7 in 2016 to 4 in 2018, which represents a 43% decrease. However, the claim is also misleading because it only focuses on the first year in office, which is cherry-picked to show a positive trend. The evidence also shows that homicides fluctuated under Irvin's tenure, and the claim ignores the increase in homicides in his second year in office.

The evidence suggests that the budget provides funding for 157,000 slots for 4-year-olds, which is 96% of the estimated 163,000 slots needed in the state. However, the number of necessary slots is not equal to the number of 4-year-olds, and some districts do not offer pre-K programs or have limited seats. Additionally, the state's funding is not a guarantee that every child will attend public preschool, as some parents may choose to send their children to private programs or keep them home until they attend kindergarten.

He also stated that any nation, including Iran, has the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The evidence shows that Obama's statement was about peaceful nuclear power, not nuclear weapons, and that he did not support Iran's right to possess nuclear weapons.

She is taking responsibility for not having the National Guard prepared for the situation, not for not having the National Guard at the Capitol. Additionally, the footage shows that Pelosi was not in charge of the National Guard deployment, as the authority to activate the District of Columbia National Guard lies with the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Army.

Additionally, his duties as a practice professor did not conform to the full range of activities typically associated with a full professor, such as teaching semester-long classes, conducting independent research, and handling administrative responsibilities.

The ban was blocked by several courts, and the policy was eventually rescinded by President Biden in 2021. During the time the ban was in effect, transgender individuals who were already serving in the military were allowed to continue serving, and new transgender recruits were allowed to enlist if they met certain medical and mental health requirements.

The evidence shows that inflation did peak at around 9% in summer 2022, and has since decreased to around 3-3.7% year-over-year. Additionally, the claim that inflation is compounding and not decreasing is also partially true, as the evidence shows that inflation has been building month after month.

Additionally, experts consider Russia's hypersonic weapons program to be somewhat overhyped, and the U.S. is expected to have a more sophisticated and reliable hypersonic missile capability in the future.

The fact that Easter happened to fall on the same day this year is simply a coincidence. While President Biden did release a statement on Easter Sunday, it was not specifically to mark Transgender Day of Visibility, but rather to acknowledge and celebrate the holiday. Additionally, his administration has acknowledged Transgender Day of Visibility by proclamation every year since he was elected, so it's not a one-time event. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it's true that President Biden acknowledged Transgender Day of Visibility, but not because he chose Easter Sunday specifically."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Joe Biden as vice president didn't 'have the right to declassify' documents\" is partially false. According to the evidence, Joe Biden as vice president did have the right to declassify documents, as stated in Executive Order 13526, which gives the president and the vice president original classification authority. However, the claim is also partially true in the sense that the vice president's declassification authority is not as clear-cut as the president's, and there is some debate among experts about the scope of the vice president's declassification powers. The evidence suggests that the vice president's declassification authority is limited to information that they originated or that was originated by their successor, and that they may not have the authority to declassify information that was classified by others. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

    "VERDICT: TRUE\nREASON: The evidence provided shows that the four major meat packers (JBS Foods, Tyson Foods, Cargill, and Marfrig) are indeed raking in record profits. According to the evidence, JBS had a record net profit of $4.4 billion, Tyson had a record $4.1 billion net profit, and Cargill delivered a record $4.9 billion in net income. Marfrig reported a net profit of $820.1 million, which is a 32% increase over 2020. The evidence also shows that meat prices are soaring, with a 12.3% increase over the 12-month period ending May 31, which is higher than the 8.6% inflation rate and 10.1% increase in overall food prices. The evidence does not suggest that the record profits are due to collusion among the companies, but rather unusual economic circumstances brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, the claim that the four big meat packers are raking in record profits is TRUE."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim \"Every Senate Democrat has voted to support unlimited abortions up to the moment of birth\" is FALSE. The evidence provided shows that while some Senate Democrats have voted in favor of certain abortion-related measures, there is no evidence to suggest that every Senate Democrat has voted to support unlimited abortions up to the moment of birth. In fact, the evidence suggests that some Senate Democrats have voted against measures that would allow for unlimited abortions up to the moment of birth. Additionally, the evidence provided shows that the claim is based on a misunderstanding of the Women's Health Protection Act of 2022, which does not allow for unlimited abortions up to the moment of birth. The act protects the right to an abortion up until the point of fetal viability, which is roughly reached at 24 weeks of pregnancy. After that point, the legislation protects the right to abortion only when, in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating healthcare provider, continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant patient's life or health."

The analysis was specific to a campaign promise by Joe Biden to ban oil and gas operations on federal lands and water, which was not implemented. However, the actual pause on leasing was brief due to a federal court order, and current oil and gas production was not impacted. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that residential non-renewable energy expenditures will increase by $18 billion (in 2020 dollars) from $247 billion to $265 billion, which is close to the $19 billion figure mentioned in the claim.

Additionally, the administration expanded access to less expensive health coverage that is not compliant with Affordable Care Act rules, which critics call \"junk insurance.\" The administration also supported congressional repeal-and-replace efforts, all of which failed. While some argue that the Trump administration's actions had unintended consequences that improved the ACA, such as increasing federal subsidies for people who buy Affordable Care Act plans, this does not constitute building upon the law.

The study did not create a new COVID-19 strain, and the claim of 100% fatality is also incorrect. The study found that all four mice infected with GX_P2V died within eight days, but this was likely due to severe brain infection, and the results are not applicable to humans. The study's findings were misinterpreted and exaggerated by social media posts and news articles, leading to widespread misinformation."

The No Surprises Act, which President Biden referred to, does provide protection against certain types of out-of-network medical bills, such as those received by patients for care at an out-of-network facility or from an out-of-network medical provider whom patients did not get to choose. This law is expected to apply to about 10 million surprise bills a year. However, the law does not cover all types of medical bills, such as those associated with using a ground ambulance to get to a hospital in an emergency, and some consumers may still receive large bills for in-network care due to hospital overcharges or insurer mistakes. Therefore, while the law does provide some relief to millions of Americans, it is not entirely accurate to say that they will no longer have to worry about unexpected medical bills."

For example, Tucker Carlson was granted an interview with Putin, and other journalists have also made requests for interviews, although they were declined. However, the claim is also partially true in the sense that many Western journalists have not been able to secure an interview with Putin, and the Kremlin has a history of declining interview requests from Western media outlets.

The evidence suggests that there are other factors at play, such as the pandemic, and that the relationship between rapid growth and high inflation is not perfect. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim is partially true, but it is also misleading and exaggerated. The claim states that if you earn $100 and pay $33 income tax, you're left with $67, and then you buy $67 worth of fuel and pay a 48% fuel tax. However, the evidence shows that the fuel tax in Australia is not 48%, but rather 22.1 cents per liter, which is a much lower rate. Additionally, the claim does not take into account the GST, which is a 10% tax on gas purchases. The total taxes paid on a $67 gas purchase would be around 19%, not 48%. The claim also lacks context about income tax rates, which vary depending on the country and individual circumstances. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is also misleading and exaggerated."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Florida's Amendment 3 is \"the monopoly amendment\" is partially true. While the amendment does allow medical marijuana treatment centers to be grandfathered into the recreational marijuana business, it does not eliminate competition or bar companies from entering the market. The amendment also allows the Florida Legislature to issue additional licenses to expand the list of marijuana sellers and distributors. However, the amendment's opponents argue that the grandfathering provision and the lack of a requirement for the state to issue additional licenses could lead to a limited market dominated by a few sellers, which could be seen as a form of monopoly. The amendment's proponents argue that the market will be competitive and that the Florida Legislature has the authority to expand the market if needed. Overall, the claim is half-true because while the amendment does have provisions that could potentially lead to a limited market, it does not eliminate competition entirely."

The claim is also correct that Exxon, Chevron, BP, and Shell profits are at their highest level in over 7 years. However, the claim's focus on the 1% figure and the timing of the high profits is misleading, as the high profits were not solely due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The law does not authorize the government to take custody of a child simply because a parent objects to gender-affirming care. Instead, it allows a Minnesota court to issue a temporary custody order with a short-term expiration date in emergency situations, such as when a child is unable to obtain gender-affirming care in another state.

This form is issued for civil violations, such as entering the country without proper documentation or overstaying a visa, and is often the only form of identification available to individuals released by ICE. While it is true that some undocumented immigrants may have an ICE Form I-200, it is not necessarily a criminal warrant, and the claim's implication that it is a criminal warrant is misleading.

The American Rescue Plan, which Brown voted for, excluded people in the country illegally from receiving stimulus checks by requiring Social Security numbers. Similarly, Brown's votes on amendments to bar immigrants in the country illegally from receiving federally subsidized health care and Social Security benefits were in line with existing laws and regulations.
