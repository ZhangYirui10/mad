      "U.S. coal capacity did peak a decade ago at around 340 gigawatts and has declined to 232 gigawatts today, Champenois said. Low-carbon alternatives have increasingly become competitive with coal on price, and the shift away from coal has been reinforced by increased attention among utilities, governments and the public to carbon emissions\u2019 role in driving climate change.",

      "The claim is that the U.S. is ahead of \"other parts of the world\" in terms of the strides it has made. Admittedly, the \"other parts of the world\" is a bit vague, but we interpret it to mean the US is doing better than many other countries that \u2013 like it \u2013 are among the largest emitters of greenhouse gases.",

      "Manchin\u2019s figure for current coal-fired plants \u2014 504 \u2014 is close to one of the figures in the Global Coal Plant Tracker database. However, Manchin used the wrong terminology to describe this number.",

The numbers work that way because it doesn\u2019t take much of those other gases to put a lot of carbon into the air.",

      "Although natural gas was the single largest factor in cutting U.S. emissions, major contributions also came from the rise in wind power and efficiency gains in American industry that lowered demand.",
      "The report said that CO2 \u2013 carbon monoxide \u2013 emissions from fossil fuel combustion fell by 8.4% in that 30-year period. Looking at just the 15-year period of 2005 to 2020, they fell 24.7%. (In the final year covered, from 2019 to 2020, the figure was 10.7%)",
      "Whether the U.S. is the world leader in cutting emissions depends on how you measure things. In total metric tons, Sullivan is right. But in relative terms, many economic peers achieved steeper declines.",
      "Overall U.S. energy production \u2014 which includes everything from heating oil to gasoline to sources used to generate electricity such as coal, natural gas and renewables \u2014 hit",

The U.S. stands out with a fall between those years of 970 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Japan\u2019s emissions went down 237 million metric tons. China, on the other hand, released an additional 4,689 million metric tons in 2020 than it did in 2005, while India\u2019s emissions rose 1,315 million metric tons.\nChart used by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to show carbon dioxide emission trends for nine countries. (Office of Dan Sullivan)\nSullivan\u2019s staff pulled these numbers from the website Our World in Data, a reliable resource based at the University of Oxford in England. The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019.\nThe first caveat to Sullivan\u2019s approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is \"conveniently misleading.\" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions.\n\"Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Jackson said.\nLooking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%."

It's nothing to just pooh-pooh, because it spreads more rapidly than the original virus, and it can cause more serious disease. But for now, the CDC recommendations stand, that if in fact you are vaccinated ... fully vaccinated, you are protected and you do not need to wear a mask, outdoors or indoors.\"",

Both to prevent you, if you happen to be a person who may feel well, but has an asymptomatic infection that you don't even know about, to prevent you from infecting someone else. But also, it can protect to a certain degree, not a hundred percent, in protecting you from getting infected from someone who, either is breathing, or coughing, or sneezing, or singing or whatever it is, in which the droplets or the aerosols go out.

And he did not indicate at any point in his 90-second reply that lockdowns should be used as a tool of coercion, as the post implies.",
      "Fauci\u2019s full comment: \"So, when you have vaccinated people who might have a breakthrough infection, and we know now as the fact, as a scientific fact, that they can transmit the virus to an uninfected person, it's for that reason that the CDC made the change in recommendation, and did, just as you correctly stated, namely, that, if you are vaccinated, if you are (in) an indoor setting, you should still wear a mask.\"",

But as I said in the past and as you accurately quoted me, the default position should be to try as best as possible within reason to keep the children in school, or to get them back to school. The best way to ensure the safety of the children in school is to get the community level of spread low. So, if you mitigate the things that you know are causing spread in a very, very profound way, in a robust way, if you bring that down, you will then indirectly and ultimately protect the children in the school because the community level is determined how things go across the board.\"",

Right now, the risk is still low, but this could change. I\u2019ve said that many times, even on this program. You\u2019ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don\u2019t need to change anything you\u2019re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change, and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.\"",

    "claim": "\"When you have unemployment below 4% and inflation above 4%, recession always follows within two years.\"",
    "evidence_full_text": [
      "Unemployment has also been below 4% between mid-2018 and the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, and also from December 2021 to the present. But the pandemic recession was an oddity caused by an external factor, and it is this recent period of employment that Summers is using to predict the next recession, so it can\u2019t also be used as historic precedent.",
      "Meanwhile, this is before we factor in high inflation. We cross-checked the months of sub-4% unemployment with inflation rates and found that none of the five months in 2000 also had inflation above 4%.",
      "On June 17, Summers told Barron\u2019s that \"when you have unemployment below 4% and inflation above 4%, recession always follows within two years.\" (Summers used the same formula in an interview with NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" two days later.)",
      "Summers\u2019 premise \u2014 that there are a decent number of time periods when unemployment was below 4% at the same time inflation was above 4% \u2014 has problems from the start. In reality, there haven\u2019t been many such periods.",
      "For about a year in 1951, unemployment was under 4% while inflation was above 4%. But inflation then dropped to 1.1% or less for the six months immediately before a recession in 1953, so this is not unequivocal evidence for Summers\u2019 larger point about high inflation being a precursor to a recession.",
      "Economists told PolitiFact that there can still be some linkage between high unemployment and low inflation (and vice versa). But this correlation can be negated by a variety of factors \u2014 factors that have been present in the economy since at least the 1990s.",
      "Let\u2019s start by looking just at the periods when unemployment was below 4%. Since 1948, unemployment has been this low only on four general occasions.",
      "Under my plan, unemployment has been under 4% for two full years now, and inflation has been at the pre-pandemic level of 2% over the last half year.",
      "We found only one clear example of Summers\u2019 rule holding \u2014 a two-year period in 1968 and 1969 when unemployment was under 4% and inflation was above 4%. That came in the immediate run-up to a recession.",
      "On the layoff front, 2024\u2019s\u00a0first two months\u00a0have been rough, but there are other measures of the economy in general, and joblessness in particular.",
      "Unemployment was below 4% for 35 straight months, from January 1951 to November 1953. It was also below 4% for 27 months from November 1967 to January 1970.",
      "The longest stretch in which the unemployment rate was \"under 4%\" during Trump\u2019s tenure was 13 months, from February 2019 to February 2020, right before the coronavirus pandemic arrived in the U.S. and sent unemployment skyrocketing. That would be shorter than the streak under Biden.",
      "Currently, the unemployment rate is 3.6% and the inflation rate is 8.6%, so if Summers\u2019 rule is correct, then the U.S. should be facing a recession sometime in the next 24 months.",
      "Consider a comparison of the rates of inflation and unemployment from 2012 to the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Inflation ran in a pretty narrow range during that period, from effectively zero to 2.9%. Yet, over the same time span, unemployment ranged from 8.3% (a level rarely reached going back to 1950) all the way down to 3.5% (close to a record low).",
      "In other words, during the nearly half-century from 1970 to 2018, there was not a single example of Summers' stated condition \u2014 unemployment under 4% and inflation over 4% \u2014 ever existing.",
      "For the following two years \u2014 April 2021 to April 2023 \u2014 inflation rose faster than wages. That means real (or inflation-adjusted) wages were falling.",
      "Although that real wages metric hasn\u2019t been released for the fourth quarter of 2022, annualized raw wages rose by almost 13% in that quarter, as inflation increased by less than 2% over the same period.",
      "The state hit its lowest unemployment rate of 2.4% in April 2023.",
      "Wage increases have outpaced inflation over the past two quarters. However, wages had fallen significantly behind inflation before that, and the recent improvements have not yet dug out of that hole.",
      "By contrast, defining a \"recession\" for one sector, such as manufacturing, is murkier. Because there\u2019s no official arbiter, someone can use one of several metrics, particularly employment level and output in goods."

The U.S. stands out with a fall between those years of 970 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Japan\u2019s emissions went down 237 million metric tons. China, on the other hand, released an additional 4,689 million metric tons in 2020 than it did in 2005, while India\u2019s emissions rose 1,315 million metric tons.\nChart used by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to show carbon dioxide emission trends for nine countries. (Office of Dan Sullivan)\nSullivan\u2019s staff pulled these numbers from the website Our World in Data, a reliable resource based at the University of Oxford in England. The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019.\nThe first caveat to Sullivan\u2019s approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is \"conveniently misleading.\" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions.\n\"Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Jackson said.\nLooking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%.",
      "\"Our per capita emissions are still twice China\u2019s and eight times higher than India\u2019s,\" Jackson said.",
      "The claim is that the U.S. is ahead of \"other parts of the world\" in terms of the strides it has made. Admittedly, the \"other parts of the world\" is a bit vague, but we interpret it to mean the US is doing better than many other countries that \u2013 like it \u2013 are among the largest emitters of greenhouse gases.",
      "Jackson raised another issue with Sullivan\u2019s chart \u2014 it left out emissions per person. China\u2019s emissions are enormous, but the country also has 1.4 billion people. Viewed through that lens, despite the decline in U.S. emissions, the United States remained the larger emitter per capita.",
      "Ritchie offered a simple explanation: Because China and India had very low levels of per capita emissions in 1990, when their economies were far less developed, their emissions have grown a lot since then. Readers wouldn\u2019t know it from this graphic, but the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan already had high levels of emissions, which didn\u2019t change very much over the same period.",
      "Whether the U.S. is the world leader in cutting emissions depends on how you measure things. In total metric tons, Sullivan is right. But in relative terms, many economic peers achieved steeper declines.",
      "Sullivan\u2019s focus on carbon dioxide doesn\u2019t give the full picture of American emissions. There are other greenhouse gases, most importantly methane and nitrous oxide. The same website that provided the carbon dioxide numbers also has data for greenhouse gases across the board.",
      "Sullivan spokesman Ben Dietderich agreed that the relative changes reshuffled the rankings, but he countered that the absolute number of tons mattered most. It\u2019s the tons of carbon dioxide that affect the global climate, he said. At the end of the day, Dietderich said, the United States made the largest contribution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions.",
      "largest emitter of carbon",
      "Factoring in all greenhouse gases, the U.S. trends are less dramatic. The total decline goes from a reduction of 879 million metric tons to 607 million metric tons. As a percentage, the decline goes from 14.3% for carbon dioxide alone to 9.5% for all greenhouse gases combined. The numbers work that way because it doesn\u2019t take much of those other gases to put a lot of carbon into the air.",
      "In the U.S., 76% of greenhouse gas emissions are CO2. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by 47% since the beginning of the Industrial Age and 11% since 2000, according to NASA.",
      "The statement contradicts piles of scientific studies showing increasing CO2 levels are contributing to rising temperatures across the globe, the efforts of industrial nations to reduce their emissions, a ruling by the Supreme Court and a statement by the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "contributing to climate change. Nearly 80% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2020 were carbon dioxide.",
      "\"I feel that many young people are being misled into thinking our country is polluting more than it ever has,\" Grothman said. \"In reality, air and water pollution have decreased significantly in the last 40 years. I also feel that given the growth of the Chinese and Indian economies, people in the U.S. have to be conscious that changes in our laws can inadvertently push jobs to these other countries who do not have the same environmental standards we do.\"",

      "The Dec. 6 Instagram post shared a screenshot, showing a number of deaths it attributed to\u00a0 vaccines: 1,621 deaths from Johnson & Johnson, 4,799\u00a0deaths from Moderna, 13,039 deaths from Pfizer and 73 from unknown vaccines. Those numbers were from the United States only, the Instagram user wrote in the caption.\n\"Only 1% of deaths are reported according to Harvard study,\" the user wrote.",
      "And again, no matter what the number of reports are in the VAERS system, those reports have yet to be verified. To say that a certain number of deaths have been caused by the COVID-19 vaccines is to make assumptions from inconclusive evidence.",
      "The FDA requires health care providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Of the 667 million doses given since December 2020, CDC has received 18,769 preliminary reports of death (0.0028%), but cautioned that such reports do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused any health problem.",
      "No vaccine is ever 100% effective, but early studies showed the protection provided by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can reduce a person's risk of infection from the virus by as much as 91%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine can reduce that risk by 66%.",
      "Studies and scientific reviews found no association between vaccination and deaths in anyone \u2014 adults or children \u2014 except in rare cases, according to a",
      "There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines were to blame for any surge in deaths in 2021.",
      "We reached out to the Instagram user for more information but did not receive a response. We searched for the Harvard study that they referenced, but were not able to find one which stated 1% of deaths are reported. We did note in a separate fact-check that a well-known anti-vaccine advocate made a similar claim and cited a study that evaluated an automated system other than VAERS that tracked a patient\u2019s health changes following a vaccination. But the study\u00a0 did not explain how it calculated 1%. The Department of Health and Human Services has said on its website that the degree of underreporting in VAERS varies widely depending on the symptom being reported.",
      "Turns out these figures are collected by an anomymous group based on unverified, broad reports of injuries and deaths that include incidents like suicides and car accidents. Many of these cases are also devoid of critical information, such as the cause of death or whether the person was vaccinated.",
      "The CDC didn\u2019t find that 75% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in individuals who had at least four other illnesses or diseases, known as comorbidities. The figure is based on a study of 1.2 million fully vaccinated people that found around 78% of deaths in the group occurred in people with multiple other illnesses, bolstering the argument that vaccines work.",
      "The suggestion that the COVID-19 vaccines might be to blame for the increase in deaths identified by OneAmerica was debunked by the Associated Press and others.",
      "\"Reports of adverse events, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a COVID-19 vaccine caused a health problem,\" Sharan added. \"Statements that imply that reports of deaths to VAERS following vaccination equate to deaths caused by vaccination are scientifically inaccurate, misleading and irresponsible.\"",
      "The Phinance report said deaths from vaccinations \"are not easily distinguished\" from deaths from other causes. But the report said that with mass vaccinations, increased natural immunity to COVID-19 and the emergence of the milder omicron variant, it\u2019s difficult to argue that COVID-19 played a large role in excess deaths in 2021 and 2022. \"Therefore, we can use the total excess mortality in 2021 and 2022 as an estimate for vaccine-related deaths,\" the report said.",
      "PolitiFact and other fact-checking organizations have repeatedly found that there is no basis for claims that COVID-19 vaccines have caused thousands of deaths.",
      "\"In the context of very high vaccine coverage in the population, even with a highly effective vaccine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases, hospitalisations and deaths would occur in vaccinated individuals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated and no vaccine is 100% effective.\"",
      "Throughout 2021, misinformation based on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System has cycled persistently throughout social media. A new claim has popped up via Instagram: that thousands of COVID-19 vaccine deaths reported in VAERS are an undercount of an actual number of deaths.",
      "Reports of people dying after they receive a COVID-19 vaccine",
      "The CDC says it has not detected any unusual or unexpected patterns for deaths following immunization that would indicate that the COVID-19 vaccines are causing or contributing to deaths, outside of nine confirmed deaths following the Janssen vaccine from Johnson & Johnson. These deaths resulted from complications of thrombosis, a rare and serious adverse reaction involving blood clots, the agency said.",
      "\"These vaccines have met rigorous scientific standards for safety and effectiveness. The available data continue to demonstrate that the benefits of these vaccines outweigh their risks,\" said Cherie Duvall-Jones, an FDA spokesperson.",
      "by the Australian government\u2019s Therapeutic Goods Administration showed that of the 944 reported deaths following vaccination from February 2021 to Nov. 13, 2022, only 14 were linked to the COVID-19 vaccination.",
      "PolitiFact has fact-checked numerous claims stating that COVID-19 vaccines have killed children. Many claims have cited the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System federal database as a source to prove that vaccines have killed hundreds of children. But VAERS reports aren\u2019t verified for accuracy before being published. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have warned continuously that reports often \"lack details and sometimes can have information that contains errors.\" That makes VAERS a breeding ground for misinformation."

The best way to ensure the safety of the children in school is to get the community level of spread low. So, if you mitigate the things that you know are causing spread in a very, very profound way, in a robust way, if you bring that down, you will then indirectly and ultimately protect the children in the school because the community level is determined how things go across the board.\"",
      "The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the agency Fauci heads, said public health recommendations have evolved as knowledge about the disease has evolved: \"The public health and scientific communities have been faced with an unprecedented and evolving pandemic event and have made recommendations in \u2018real time\u2019 according to the best scientific data available at that time.\"",

In this June 29, 2021, clip from an interview with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt, Fauci was responding to concerns about the surge in delta variant cases and said that the CDC guidance on masks stood \"for now.\"",

Right now, the risk is still low, but this could change. I\u2019ve said that many times, even on this program.

      "The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan arm of Congress that examines the spending and tax impacts of legislation, found that the Build Back Better bill would raise taxes by roughly $1.27 trillion over 10 years.",
      "To unpack this \u2014 just a little bit \u2014 Congress passed a budget resolution that set a ceiling on how much, if any, a bill like Build Back Better could add to the deficit.\u00a0 When the CBO scored the bill as adding $158 billion to the deficit, the Democrats were well below the ceiling they had set. (Technically, the CBO said the bill added $365 billion, but it also figured that IRS enforcement would help offset that by $207 billion.)",
      "\"The Congressional Budget Office says it's not paid for,\" Graham said Dec. 12. \"It's $3 trillion of deficit spending.\"",
      "In all, the expenditures in the CARES Act totaled $2.3 trillion, which is well above the price tag of the Build Back Better bill, and the money in the CARES Act was designed to be infused into the economy more quickly.",
      "A third bill making a major contribution to the national debt is the 2021 American Rescue Plan, signed by President Joe Biden with the exclusive support of Democrats. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that this law will increase the debt by $2.1 trillion.",
      "The CBO estimated 6,252,000 new jobs would be added for the year. It did not factor in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which Biden signed into law on March 11, 2021, providing millions of Americans with a third stimulus check and extending enhanced weekly federal employment benefits. (Nor did it forecast the delta and omicron variants of COVID-19 and the economic impact they would have.)",
      "But the coronavirus pandemic sent the annual deficit into record territory. In 2020, Trump\u2019s fourth year, the deficit skyrocketed to $3.13 trillion, largely because of government stimulus payments, unemployment insurance expansions, business operation grants and increased funding for public health.",
      "Graham is incorrect. The bill passed by the House and now in the Senate\u2019s hands costs about $1.75 trillion, and, according to CBO figures, would add $158 billion to the deficit over 10 years, not $3 trillion. (President Joe Biden and other Democrats say even that smaller deficit would evaporate thanks to IRS crackdowns on tax evaders.)",
      "estimated the law, based on the new Congressional Budget Office estimates and the original projected savings, would increase the deficit by $306 billion over 10 years.",
      "In third place was $5.9 trillion in new spending to keep the government running, enacted outside of major stimulus packages, typically through annual bills",
      "\"These estimates do not reflect what is actually written in the Build Back Better Act nor its official cost for scorekeeping purposes,\" the deficit hawk group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote. \"Lawmakers may choose to allow some provisions to expire, to extend some as written, and to modify some.\"",

      "One missing piece in Biden\u2019s budget is any effect of Build Back Better legislation, a domestic spending package of Biden priorities that remains stalled in Congress. It\u2019s not clear how much spending will be included in these bills, how Congress will pay for it, and what the effect on the deficit would be.",
      "Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, said that if the economy-stimulating effects of all three bills are considered, Biden\u2019s numbers seem reasonable. He added that estimating how much bills spur private investment is hard because no one knows how much investment there\u00a0might have been absent the legislation.",
      "The Biden administration estimated this tax would generate $360 billion in revenue over the next decade \u2014 not the full $1 trillion that the claim suggested. The rest would be made up by other measures in Biden\u2019s budget proposal, but that, too, lacks detail.",
      "The House approved a version of the Build Back Better Act in November. No action has been taken in the Senate. The House version of the bill would spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office shows that, to date, the Trump tax cuts have added about $949 billion to the national debt, the CARES Act has added more than $1.9 trillion, and the American Rescue Plan has added nearly $1.7 trillion."
